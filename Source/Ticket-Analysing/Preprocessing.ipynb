I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018.

       "11  On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",
