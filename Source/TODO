TOMORROW 6.05.2024:

- Create a simple website for ticketing requests.
  It should have a priority, a category and a description field.
  On the right side, should be a ticket solution suggestion.

- Ask ChatGOT to create some solution to the tickets.

- Create a code to check the chosen category of the user and display real time solutions of this category
  When writing the description, the code will also take tags from the field and look for solutions of those tags.

- Write a code who sends the ticket to the server and displays the ticket status.

- Write code to classify current ticket and checks if the ticket as a second category from the user if yes,
  then it will make it as a sub category and assign it to the agent.

- Write a code which creates a connection with an Group server like discord and sends the ticket to the corresponding channel.



OPENAI Solutions:

- Automated Responses: Use the AI to generate initial responses or suggestions for common ticket types.
            Human agents can then review and modify these responses as needed before sending them to users.
- Information Retrieval: AI can help agents quickly retrieve relevant information from knowledge bases or
                         documentation to assist with ticket resolution.
- Chatbots: Implement chatbots for initial triage and basic troubleshooting.
          Chatbots can engage with users in real-time, gather necessary information, and either provide solutions or escalate complex issues to human agents.
- Discord has bots in it so use it for tasks
- Build channels and into that channels, build priority queues and assign tickets to the queues.
- Build also an conversation queue for the agents.
