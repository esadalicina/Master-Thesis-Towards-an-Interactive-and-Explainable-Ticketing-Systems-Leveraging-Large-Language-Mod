Since this, I also tried to open a Chase XXXX card and received the denial reason of "" Previous unsatisfactory relationship with bank ''. I understand their concerns then since my credit file was a little thin and new but clearly today is different with a > XXXX credit score. I have never defaulted on a loan or even ever been late with a payment and have thus clearly demonstrated being a good credit risk, at least for a checking account. I opened this account because of the convenience of a branch to my home. I am kindly asking for this to be reconsidered due to the time that has passed and also it being based on actions I didn't even know were a problem. I am submitting this request through the CFPB because it is the only effective way to reach the Office of the President. Thank you."

Account fell behind on a monthly payment and Chase unilaterally suspended account and increased interest. As the authorized person on the business credit card account I reached an oral settlement agreement with Chase on XX/XX/XXXX, outlined in part in a letter sent from Chase to my office confirming outline of settlement agreement to my office. I made timely payments per the settlement agreement ; however, Chase did not update the account status and pay history as agreed to "" settled '' for account status and current for pay histories for months of XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. I only entered into the settlement agreement based on the understanding that Chase would perform these corrections for the credit reporting on the account so it would not negatively affect my business or personal credit opportunities going forward.

I attempted to correct these issues with Chase twice in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX with no success. In anticipation of applying for home mortgage pre-qualification in XX/XX/XXXX, I again reached out to Chase requesting that it correct these incorrect derogatory credit reporting issues. Chase responded by updating the payment status to 90 days late, in breach of our settlement agreement and adversely lowering my credit score, and by updating the pay history to reflect Negative for the month of XX/XX/XXXX, as opposed to closed and current on payments as the account was per the settlement agreement and my performance of the same. 

I again reached out to Chase in XX/XX/XXXX by phone after an indication an application for a substantial business line of credit was preliminary denied specifically based on the incorrect credit reporting for this account that has still not been corrected by Chase. I I disputed the incorrect information through an online dispute process with XXXX, by phone, and have sent a certified letter and supporting documentation concerning why the reporting is incorrect and in violation of our prior settlement agreement. I have also requested account notes from Chase and have been informed I will not be given the account notes without enforceable legal process seeking such account notes.

Chase has confirmed we entered into a settlement agreement on XX/XX/XXXX, and I performed all my obligations per the agreement ; however, it persists that it can not report the account as paid as agreed from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX and that even though its letter confirming the settlement agreement stated the account was closed in XXXX they continue to persist they can not report my account as paid as agreed for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have attempted every method to amicably resolve this erroneous credit reporting short of litigation and this is my last effort to resolve this matter without litigating Chase 's failure to perform its obligations per our settlement agreement."

However, on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I received a letter and a text message from Chase advising me that my mortgage loan was transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had not received a welcome letter from XXXX I did not know where to send my mortgage payment. However, I was not too concerned because I know in the past if my other loan was transferred, I had a 60day grace period to get everything situated. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I had an automatic mortgage payment from XXXX XXXX XXXX taken from my Chase Bank account in the amount of {$890.00}. 

I was a little flustered because I was not aware the money was going to be taken from my bank account. I never authorized XXXX to take any money out of my account. I had just received a welcome letter from them 2 days prior. At any rate, I said to myself- if the mortgage would have still been with Chase , they would have taken it out of my account so I let it go. 

Apparently- Chase provided XXXX all of my information including my bank information. My loan with Chase was set up on auto draft and came out of my account every month on the XXXX so it appeared XXXX was doing the same. 

That said, on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I had an automatic withdrawal from my account from XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$920.00}??? 

I called Chase Customer Service I was on hold for literally an hour. I asked the representative what the payment was for? She advised- it appeared to be a payment I had authorized and set up. I told her I had never heard of the company before and asked if it was for a mortgage? She said she didn't know. I asked if there was a phone number associated with the transaction- she said no. She wasn't very helpful so hung up with her and I drove to the Chase Branch in XXXX, CA. I spoke with the manager XXXX. He said I needed to make an appointment because he only had 1 banker. However- as I waited in my car, he looked up my account and brought me back some forms to fill out to dispute the transaction. I asked him as well if it was for a mortgage and told him how XXXX took money out of my account without my authorization. He also said he didn't know and said there was no phone number associated with the transaction. 

Around XXXX XXXX the branch manager called me and said he heard back from his back office and they advised him to tell me that I needed to close my bank account and open a new one and change my passwords. 

I assumed that someone from the back office was able to see something that I could not so I took his advice and made an appointment with the XXXX branch to have my account closed and open a new one. 

I met with XXXX the banker in XXXX and she had me change my email address and passwords to open up the new account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a very disturbing letter from Chase advising they were closing my account. I was very perplexed and thought they were referring to the account I had previously closed until I saw the account number- it was the new account I had just opened!!! 

I called the number on the letter XXXX XXXX XXXX and the representative said my account was going to be permanently closed on XXXX XXXX. I asked her why- she said Chase does not have to give a reason. She further stated when I opened the account I agreed by when I signed the forms that Chase could close my account at any time. Even though, the banker pretty much singed all the documents on my behalf because of COVID-19. Anyway, she said the decision could not be over turned. And that I needed to have my money out of the account by XX/XX/XXXX or it would be a process for me to get it after the account is closed. 

I was very puzzled by the letter and the conversation and had no Idea what happened or why I was being treated this way. 

I decided to go online and set up payments for my bills to come out of a checking account that I had with another institution since this one with Chase would soon be closed. 

I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX website to set up my mortgage payment with the other institution and guess what??? it said my last payment to them was made on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$920.00}??? 

Put Simply, I never authorized for XXXX to take out a mortgage payment on XXXX XXXX but they did. Then they took out XXXX 's mortgage payment not on XX/XX/XXXX but XX/XX/XXXX for a different amount and it was under a different name XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Unbeknownst to me I thought I was a victim of fraud and went through a lot to get the account closed and to reopen a new one. Additionally- I was not prepared for XXXX XXXX XXXX to take money out of my account. I have been stressed and XXXX ever since not to mention- Chase has elected to close my account after all these years due to a misunderstanding. 
Chase provided the company my information. They took money out of my account- twice. They used different names for the withdrawal 's and took out different payment amounts Once again, when the unknown transaction appeared on my account, I called and visited a Chase Branch- I asked if it was for a mortgage and if there was a number, I could call to find out what the transaction was for- I was told NO. 
When I called XXXX- I was told they go by both company names. I also asked why did they take out different amounts- he said I agreed to have them take out an additional principal payment. I told him, I never spoke to anyone from his company before and I definitely hadn't spoken to anyone between XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. He also said the payment taken out of the XXXX was done manually and the one on the XXXX was set up on the withdrawal. I further asked him, who authorized XXXX to change the date from the XXXX to the XXXX he could NOT answer the question. 
This is really a mess and at a time like this when folks stress levels are already high-I have been treated unfairly by both institutions at no fault of my own."

XXXX had called her bank and cancelled her card and reported the fraudulent activity. I had also called chase and reported the fraudulent activity and they opened the claim. It has now been XXXX weeks, the claim has been denied and Chase refuses to reopen the claim and assist me with recouping the money, they deemed it as a loss and have instructed me to forget about it and move on.

I'm at a dead end, XXXX can not assist me and Chase won't assist me in figuring out where this money went and how to get it back. Please help!"

Yesterday my family in XXXX used wire transfer to transfer {$5000.00} to my Chase Sapphire checking account. For Chase Sapphire checking account, per Chase policy, there should be no wire transfer fee for either outgoing or incoming wire transfers. Meantime, my family already paid separately the wire transfer fees to XXXX bank, in which they initiated this wire transfer. Therefore, the amount that I should receive in my Chase checking account should be exactly {$5000.00}. However, there was only {$4900.00} deposited into my Chase checking account from this wire transfer. Apparently, Chase charged me {$15.00} hidden fee for this incoming wire transfer. My family further inquired with XXXX bank and was told by XXXX bank that the wire transfer amount that I should receive should be exactly {$5000.00}. XXXX bank confirmed that the missing {$15.00} must be charged by Chase as the receiving bank.

I reported this issue to Chase Private Client customer service. However, Chase representative treated me very impatiently and unprofessionally. She didn't resolve this issue at all. I am very disappointed with your Chase Bank customer service. 

I am escalating this issue to CFPB, and am requesting Chase to immediately post the {$15.00} to my Chase Sapphire Checking account because Chase should NOT charge me this {$15.00} fee at all."

As a result, I have been dealing with this situation for three months with no resolution. As the chain of events are read, I 'm perplexed as there is no process in place for situations like this. I 'm certain I 'm not the first or will be the last person to be faced with this issue. Additionally, I realize the amount is minimal but at this point it 's the principle of not having a process in place and someone other than my son received {$140.00}. 
Chain of Events : 1. Took advantage of the process to send my son money ( a XXXX who resides in XXXX ) from my XXXX account to his Chase checking account via the XXXX XXXX vendor ( which was solicited through accessing my XXXX account ). This amount was for {$140.00} and sent on XXXX/XXXX/2016. The funds were immediately debited from my account. 
2. My son accepted the transfer and completed a profile with XXXX XXXX to complete the process. 
3. My son and I received notification the funds were available as of XXXX/XXXX/2016. However, when my son checked his account, the funds were never transferred as confirmed. 
4. I contacted XXXX advising of the issue and was advised the funds were successfully transferred, to wait a few more days, and call back if the funds are yet to be transferred. 
5. I waited and no transfer to my son 's Chase account. I called XXXX back and was advised I needed to contact Chase with tracking number, XXXX to see if they could track where the funds transferred. 
6. My son and I called Chase on a conference call and explained the situation, the representative confirmed the funds did not transfer and advised they could n't help. The representative suggested to file a claim with my bank ( XXXX ). I advised I took those actions already hence the reason for the call. The representative laughed and advised I must be clear on advising my bank I need to file an ACH claim. 
7. I called XXXX again and advised of the situation. I was then advised there was absolutely nothing they could do and I needed to call the vendor for resolution. 
8. My son and I called the vendor on a conference call and was advised they could n't assist with a resolution and I needed to call my bank and/or Chase. I advised both actions were taken hence the reason we are contacting them. The representative then advised they would attempt to look into it but unlikely they 'd be able to assist. 
9. My son nor I heard back from the vendor as advised, so I decided to send an online inquiry to XXXX requesting to open an ACH claim as I 've been going back and forth with all parties with no resolution. 
10. After several online inquiries, XXXX submitted a claim with the vendor for further research. 
11. A month went by without a response or resolution. I sent another online inquiry to XXXX and received a response indicating there was nothing the vendor could do and I needed to contact Chase for resolution. I advised again that my son and I went down that route with no resolution. The XXXX representative working my claim attempted to contact Chase directly but was advised there was nothing they could do unless possibly my son, myself, XXXX and Chase are on a conference call. I advised at this time with my son 's and my schedule it would be too challenging to attempt to coordinate such a call. Also, I 've spent too much time already attempting to resolve this matter with all parties as suggested. 
Which brings me to this point of writing a regulatory complaint for further review/resolution as I believe there should be a more efficient process and/or a process created to alleviate future cases for other customers."

She put me on hold again, and returned and said she would not help me. I insisted on an explanation, and she refused. 

This is not just bad service it is theft! The minimum a customer should be able to expect from a bank is that if the customer deposits good money, he should be able to draw it out when he wants. Even if the bank has no sense of ethics, there must be some regulation that requires that they not obstruct my transactions and confiscate my money"

XX/XX/2019 I contacted Chase fraud department and they referred me to call the wire department. Their wire department was closed till Monday. I talked to XXXX the account is still active and funds are available for the amount of {$1600.00}. 
XX/XX/2019 I contacted the wire department XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX. They said in 24 to 48 hrs they would process the bank wire recall. 
XX/XX/2019 I contacted the wire department and no update. I informed them that XXXX is going to request a Hold Harmless Letter. The representative informed me that not to worry they will take care of it and its still processing. I talked to XXXX the account is still active and funds are available for the amount of {$1600.00}. 
XX/XX/2019 I contacted the wire department. A representative told me, Im mama but the bank recall was denied by the other bank. There is nothing we can do. I ask to speak to a manager. After a 30 minutes of being on hold, I was transferred to manager XXXX. XXXX said he will escalate this to the investigators because XXXX is requesting a Hold Harmless letter. That it doesnt seem like they want to return the money. I informed Chase that the account was still open and the funds are in the account. XXXX said an investigator will call me within 24 to 48hrs. I talked to XXXX the account is still active and funds are available for the amount of {$1600.00}. 
XX/XX/2019 I called Chase wire department to informed them that the account with XXXX is still open and the funds are still in the account. I offered the police report number and they refused. No update on when the investigator will call me. I talked to XXXX the account is still active and funds are available for the amount of {$1600.00}. 
XX/XX/2019 I had a missed call at XXXX, ( which is outside normal business hours ). I called back the wire department and was transferred to XXXX. XXXX said he will email them about calling me back within normal business hours. XXXX said he will email XXXX to inform them that a Hold Harmless letter is being processed. XXXX said he would call me back. No call back. When I called back I was on hold for 45 minutes and then disconnected. I was hung up on many times when I was trying to follow up with the investigators. I talked to XXXX the account is still active and funds are available for the amount of {$1600.00}. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX weekend all offices were closed. 
XX/XX/2019 I had to call the wire department 20 times. Finally, I was transferred to XXXX, he said the investigators will not be calling me back. I need to print out everything I had and take it to my local bank and they can fax or email them the information. I went to Chase bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX. I handed over everything I had screenshots of emails, XXXX messages, copy of the lease agreement, text messages and police report number to XXXX XXXX ( Branch Manager Vice President ). XXXX said, he doesnt have any communication with the wire department or their email. I gave him the wire department number and case number. He said he was really busy and will do it when he can. I return two hours later, he said he email the wire department. XXXX said there is nothing he can do, that I will have to contact the wire department. 
XX/XX/2019 I contacted the wire department and XXXX informed me that they have received my documents. For 4 hours prior to talking to XXXX, I was hung up on by XXXX in the wire department and refused to transfer me to XXXX. XXXX yelled and argued with me because I did not know the exact amounts in my bank accounts. He refused to look up my account by my social security number, address and case number. I learned from another representative that XXXX never sent the email to XXXX bank letting them know that Chase was working on this account. 
XX/XX/2019 I called for 3 hours. XXXX refused to talk to me. I was told by a wire representative to go to my local bank they have the answers for me. XXXX said that he doesnt have any information for me, and I had to call the wire department. After four hours of calling I talked to XXXX. XXXX said my Hold Harmless letter request was denied. I ask why, he refused to give me a reason. I call XXXX in tears. I was transferred to their wire fraud department and talked to XXXX. XXXX took my information, police report number, and ask if I can provide them with records of emails, text messages and police report. I said I had everything except the police report that it takes days for XXXX police to email me the report, but I had the badge number, phone, and police report number. XXXX said she will send an email to put the Hold Harmless investigations in motion. XXXX said for me to call the wire department to do another recall request, and for them to forward the information I sent them. I called back for three hours. The representatives kept hanging up on me and refused to transfer me to the manager. I finally got into contact with XXXX who I informed what XXXX told me. XXXX said we will do another recall but they dont want to give you back your money thats why they are asking for a Hold Harmless letter. I explained this is their procedure. They need to justify why they are returning the money. XXXX again told me to talk to XXXX. XXXX told me to call the wire department. XXXX called the wire department and said it looks like XXXX doesnt want to give you back your money. I informed everyone the account was still open and the funds are still there. 
XX/XX/2019 XXXX called me at XXXX and said he will take my complaints to the executive branch. He said he is trying to help me and doesnt know why the wire department keeps sending me back to him. He said someone should be calling me by Tuesday.. I called Wire department at XXXX. I was on hold for 30 minutes. I talked to XXXX from the wire department, I gave him my name and that I wanted an update on my wire recall. He ask me for my account number, I told him I didnt have it. XXXX hung up on me. At XXXX I called the wire department. XXXX said no bank recall was done, in fact only one was done. The Hold Harmless was denied and the case is closed. I requested to get transfer to XXXX and he said another recall will not be done because they will just ask for another Hold Harmless Letter. XXXX sent an email to XXXX requesting the money to be returned without a Hold Harmless Letter. Again the Wire department lied to me. 
My complaint is that Chase is not doing to due diligence in helping me. Chase wire department are not willing to do the Hold Harmless letter because its just too much work for them. They are refusing to send the documents to XXXX because their intentions is to punish my family and I for being scammed. I am requesting that the FTC investigated the consumer practices of Chase bank. I feel that if I wasnt a minority I would have been provided with better customer service and a Hold Harmless letter would have been provided. My family life savings are in these accounts that are intended for my daughter to go to college. By losing this money we are distressed and my daughter is becoming XXXX. My daughter is set back in her education because of this. Every penny we  need for her college education. Chase is destroying lives for people of color. Please help me.

One of which is JP Morgan Chase Bank on XX/XX/XXXX.. XXXX indicates JP Morgan Chase Bank , XXXX, LA, is servicer and investor on XX/XX/XXXX with min # matching my loan number so this indicates that Chase was indeed the lender/servicer. Notarized documents XX/XX/XXXX are from Louisiana as well. The Loan that I signed for that amount and that date was with XXXX who is not listed on the credit report nor XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX loan document liabilities worksheet lists acct type mortgage for XXXX owing to XXXX XXXX XXXX with remaining term of 142 months and acct type revolving loan XXXX. owing to XXXX with remaining term 144 months. Lets see, in XX/XX/XXXX I purchased the property, refinanced in XX/XX/XXXXand XX/XX/XXXX which XXXX shows XXXX XXXX XXXX as servicer on both to whom I never made a single payment to. So as of XX/XX/XXXX I had already been making payments on a mortgage for approx 17 years for a house only lived in for 6 yrs? The revolving acct type was a XX/XX/XXXX HELOC/consumer installment note, for XXXX in which XXXX XXXX was lender, this loan does not show up on the credit report as well, but shows an amount for XXXX which has been paid off. Additionally on liability worksheet apparent delinquent property taxes in the amount of XXXX. Which may also appear on loan documents somewhere as lender title insurance fee. Not addressed in previous complaint marked as resolved is the issue of the "" fake loan '' in XX/XX/XXXX. Which shows a liability to Chase Manhatten for XXXX. Payments prior to XX/XX/XXXX where made to XXXX residential lending, from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX who followed XXXX aka Chase from XX/XX/XXXX. Chase did not reference or explain any of the XX/XX/XXXX refi loan documents that I submitted for the complaint as suggested by CFPB. Foreclosure paperwork initiated by "" Chase '' XX/XX/XXXX, foreclosing documents sent to me included the XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Deed Of Trust, recorded XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Auditor file XXXX. The XX/XX/XXXX loan documents indicate that Public records indicate that I still have a XXXX XXXX lien after the foreclosure/sale of my property occurring on XX/XX/XXXX. Two full reconveyances recorded XX/XX/XXXX have since been removed from my XXXX summary at the XXXX XXXX Auditor without any further assignments and/or changes after XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. The credit report indicates a wrong initiation date of foreclosure. XXXX represenative informs me I am still making payments to XXXX XXXX XXXX with whom I have a high credit limit of XXXX. I have not made payments on that XXXX/Chase XXXX loan since XX/XX/XXXX. Additionally in XX/XX/XXXX the heloc loan was to be paid off which I suspect never was. The XX/XX/XXXX refi was to be a fixed rate and done to get out of the XX/XX/XXXX ARM loan. I can make heads nor tails from the credit report re the interest rate on the loan. It indicates its an adjustable rate, which I already said it could be considered that with the Home Affordable Loan Modification that is not recorded. The XX/XX/XXXX Deed of Trust also included an adjustable rate note and an adjustable rate rider, only one of those is barcoded, the land description, has mismatched fonts and may not have been even included with the deed, The deed itself has many changes after I signed it. I have received a XXXX, apparently related to the sale on XX/XX/XXXX with amounts listed on it that makes no sense, yet I still have a debt of XXXX out there somewhere.

Since I had recently dealt with three of my credit cards one being through Chase - Amazon XXXX credit card, and the other two from XXXX  and XXXX XXXX  this just seemed like another instance from the same person or people from before since all of the fraudulent charges were coming from Amazon. 

As the call went on, the person I was speaking to asked for my full debit card number so they could send me a code to access my account. What I didnt realize at the time was that this was a phone scam and they were gaining access to my checking account to transfer money out and steal it. The number they called in on was a legitimate Chase number, but they were not employees of Chase and had spoofed the number. They also spoofed the number they sent the two factor authentication codes on to make it seem like it was coming from Chase. 

It wasnt until I was put on a hold while the individual I was speaking to spoke to their manager that I realized what had happened and I was locked out of my Chase online banking account. I quickly reset my password and username and got access to my account only to find that they had already transferred out {$2000.00} from my checking account. They used the XXXX with XXXX feature and added the scammers information an email address of XXXX and had set the name of the recipient to Chase to look legitimate. 

I immediately called Chase customer claims to initiate a fraud dispute claim and proceeded to close out my current checking and savings accounts with them as they had been compromised. I had to initiate the claim over the phone since the branch did not offer this option. However, the branch did close out my accounts and replaced my debit card. I also filed a police report with the XXXX Police Department, and filed an Identity Theft report as I was instructed to do by their Fraud Prevention team. Additionally, I placed a fraud alert on all of my credit reports due to severity and pattern of recent unauthorized activity. 

I only received an initial claim letter by email from Chase about this claim. I had to call them for almost 2 weeks just to get any type of status update on the claim itself, if they needed additional info from me, when I was going to receive my stolen money back, etc. I was finally awarded a provisional credit on XX/XX/2021 for my stolen money as they were investigating my claim. They told me this can take up to a full month or more to complete and I would hear from them if they needed any additional documentation. 

I didnt hear anything else from Chase about this claim until XX/XX/2021 where they again only sent a PDF letter via email with an update. The update was that they for some reason concluded that this was not fraudulent and that they are planning to reverse the credit they issued for my stolen money. When I called and spoke to a claims representative, they told me it was denied because the device history did not show unauthorized activity. This makes absolutely ZERO sense because upon viewing my device access history you can blatantly see a completely different, unknown browser, with an IP address location outside of the state. I do not use a VPN, so this is the only device on the account that is not normal or recognized. I have included a screenshot of my device history that shows this unauthorized login on the day that my money was stolen. 

I am requesting a copy of my police report and sending over my identity theft report to Chase as I have to appeal this by XX/XX/2021 or the claim will be denied and my money reversed. The fact that I have to appeal something that is so clearly fraudulent is beyond me. I was hardly informed throughout this entire process and even with proof of unauthorized/fraudulent activity, they still insist that this is something I authorized. I was clearly a victim of a phone scam, with THEIR number being spoofed and unlawfully used no less, and this is how they handle the situation. I will not stopped until this is made right."

Prior to delivery of the equipment and completely unbeknownst to me ; the buyer requested a credit card chargeback of the {$15000.00} payment and yet still took delivery of the equipment! That is out and out fraud. 

I was never aware of the charge back request at any time until a week AFTER the customer took delivery and signed off as accepting the merchandise in perfect condition. Once I was made aware of the issue by XXXX, I contacted the customer and informed them that I was bringing legal action against him for fraud. He attempted to portray that entire incident as his bank 's fault and "" a big misunderstanding.

I have been completely shut down in my business due to this incident that is entirely outside of my control. I did exactly as I agreed to do and I delivered the merchandise in perfect condition. I have other cash payments and other customers that have had their purchases halted because XXXX has frozen all of my accounts while waiting for confirmation of the reversal of the credit card chargeback request. I have been told that it could be 2-3 MONTHS before Chase Bank and XXXX process the reversal and allow me access to my own money!!! 

That is not fair, and most likely not even legal and adhering to current banking laws. In the 21st century, when financial institutions can authorize and send money anywhere in the world in a fraction of a second ... they should be able to REVERSE a transaction quite easily. They should not be allowed to freeze a small business owners accounts and put them out of business while they take their sweet time to process the reversal of a charge back request. I am requesting that the federal government get involved to address these arcane, patently unfair and totally outdated financial institution practices."

I would like to issue a complaint against JP Morgan Chase. Some background information. I am a government employee. We were issued several years back a XXXX XXXX travel credit card by JP Chase Bank NA, account no. ending in xxxx, to use for official government travel expenses. In XXXX ( I do not recall the specific dates ) the agency decided to close the JP Morgan Chase accounts and move to an other bank. We now use a XXXX XXXX Visa by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I have a personal Chase Marriot XXXX Visa credit card, account no. ending in xxxx that I use for my personal expenses. I received my XX/XX/XXXX billing statement from Chase Marriot in the amount of {$5000.00}. I have Bill Pay through my local bank, xxxxxx Bank. When I setup the Bill Pay to pay the Chase Marriott balance in the amount of {$5000.00}, I erroneously selected the wrong payee, a closed JP Chase Bank NA, account no. ending in xxxx. The correct payee should have been my personal Chase Marriott account ending in xxxx for payment on XX/XX/XXXX. Apparently, I had never delete the closed JPMorgan Chase account from my Bill Pay accounts. 
I received several email alerts on XX/XX/XXXX from my Chase Marriot XXXX Visa credit card that the amount was due and no payment had been made to date. The payment due date was XX/XX/XXXX. I did some research and learned that day, XX/XX/XXXX,, that my electronic Bill Pay sent a paper check to the wrong payee account. I went to my personal bank account and saw a check image of a deposited check in the amount of {$5000.00} to my closed JP Chase Bank NA, account no. ending in xxxx. I immediately issued another {$5000.00} via ACH from my personal bank account to my personal Chase Marriot XXXX Visa credit card, account no. ending in xxxx to pay the current amount so as to not incur any late fees and charges. 

At this point I started to make phone calls to my bank at XXXX, Chase Customer Service XXXX ( my personal visa account ) and JP Morgan Chase Bank NA customer service ( XXXX ). My first call on XX/XX/XXXX was to my bank to ask how do I get my money back as it was sent to the wrong payee and to a closed account. I was told that the check would most likely not be posted to a closed account and it should be posted back to my account and that I should call my personal Chase Visa customer service to notify them of my mistake. 

I then decided to write JP Chase Bank NA, closed account no. ending in xxxx at JP Morgan Chase Bank NA, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX IL XXXX ( this was the remit to address my check was sent to ). I got the remit to information an old XX/XX/XXXX Statement and I mailed a letter to the remit to address stating what had happened providing them with a copy of the deposited check image to see if they would respond in writing as I could not reach them directly. My bank provided me with a phone number to contact the JPMorgan Chase bank associated with my old closed account ; however, the number I called had a prerecorded message to call back later. I never received any response from my letter and no one ever answered the phone. 

I then called JPMorgan Chase Bank NA Commercial Card Solutions customer service number XXXX from my old statement. I spoke with a rep and was told that they did not have access to that account as it was closed and they no longer have access to that system. I was told to call the government agency finance office which made little sense as JPMorgan Chase had cashed my Bill Pay check and deposited it into some Chase account on XX/XX/XXXX per the deposit information on the back of the check. I told them I have evidence of the check image ; however, they told me there was nothing they could do. They told me they could not help because it was a closed government account no longer under contract with JPMorgan Chase. 

As you can imagine, I am getting very frustrated as no one wants to take ownership of my problem and provide me with a resolution path to get back a significant amount of money, {$5000.00}. 

I then called Chase Customer Service XXXX ( my personal visa account ) on XX/XX/XXXX and I was connected eventually to the Chase Payments Team ( a.k.a Payments Research Team ) and was instructed to fax them at XXXX a letter stating my payment of {$5000.00} went to the wrong Chase Account and I would like to get the amount moved from my closed JP Chase Bank NA, account no. ending in xxxx to my personal Chase Marriot XXXX Visa credit card, account no. ending in xxxx. I was asked to include the check image as evidence which I sent in the letter along with permission for Chase to contact me at home for resolution at xxx-xxx-xxxx. I was told by a gentleman that this will be researched and corrected in a few days. 

I waited approximately two days ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and went online to my personal Chase Visa account and saw a credit of {$5000.00} on my account and I thought the resolution process was proceeding as a temporary credit was issued while it was researched. On XX/XX/XXXX, I looked online at my personal Chase Visa account and a debit of {$5000.00} was posted to my account so I was back to square one. Also, both the credit and debit transactions were dated XX/XX/XXXX. I once again contacted Chase Customer Service XXXX ( my personal visa account ) on XX/XX/XXXX and I was connected eventually to the Chase Payments Team ( a.k.a. Payments Research Team ) and was instructed once again to fax them at XXXX a letter stating my payment of {$5000.00} went to the wrong JPMorgan Chase Account and I would like to get the amount moved from my closed JP Chase Bank NA, account no. ending in xxxx to my personal Chase Marriot XXXX Visa credit card, account no. ending in xxxx. I sent the same fax sent on XX/XX/XXXX with the check image as evidence which I sent in the letter along with permission for Chase to contact me at home for resolution at xxx-xxx-xxxx. I was told by the payment supervisor, XXXX, that this will be researched and a resolution provided in 7 to ten days business days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, correspondence was mailed from Chase Services XXXX and received by me on XX/XX/XXXX stating a credit of {$5000.00} was issued to my Chase account ending in xxxx. I subsequently received a post card from Chase several days later that they have made an adjustment to my account to debit back the {$5000.00} as it was credited in error. These adjustments, dated XX/XX/XXXX are reflected on my XX/XX/XXXX Chase Visa statement. I had hoped the letter ( s ) were a refund check or some explanation for resolution. At this point I need to pay another {$5000.00} plus to pay my XX/XX/XXXX statement as my original check and deposit of {$5000.00} has not been credited back to my account or returned to my bank account. 
Extremely frustrated, I contacted Chase Customer Service XXXX ( my personal visa account ) once again on Monday XX/XX/XXXX to see if any progress was made in their research efforts as this is a significant loss of money. I was transferred to payments supervisor XXXX who tried to help me find the closed account for over an hour. She eventually asked me to hold the line and I was transferred to a JPMorgan Chase card holder services rep named XXXX who told me that she would take down my information to research the deposit and try to get resolution. She asked many questions about the former closed government card trying to determine what government agency had the account with JPMorgan Chase. I provided her with my name, phone number where I could be reached and she asked me to email my account information with the subject line of the email stating the last four digits of my old account xxxx to their email account at XXXX along with the check image. She provided no timeframe for resolution. I sent her the email immediately. 

Other than the email address, I have no way to contact JPMorgan Chase. Again, frustrated with no response for days and given the large sum of money out of pocket, I emailed JPMorgan Chase cardholder services once again on Thursday XX/XX/XXXX to try to get a status on the resolution of my problem. As I write this complaint on Sunday morning, XX/XX/XXXX, I have had no contact from JPMorgan Chase, no defined resolution process and I still have no access to my {$5000.00} dollars that was deposited to a closed account on XX/XX/XXXX. I have redacted all of my PII from this memo. I have the check image of the deposited check as evidence as well as all other statements and account information referenced in this letter. I did not attach the check image as it has PII on it. 

Thank you for you time and consideration in this perplexing issue."

Chase, in response to the complaint, provided transaction information which we shared with the vendor.

I am trying to buy a house, but there is a late payment from XXXX on my credit report. I have contacted JP Morgan Chase four times, and each time they have refused to work with me. This single delinquency is affecting my ability to qualify for favorable mortgage terms. 

I was hospitalized on XX/XX/XXXX for respiratory failure. Within days I was intubated and sedated, and placed into an induced coma. I was put on XXXX XXXX XXXX  -- a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, that cleaned and XXXX XXXX XXXX outside of my body to give my XXXX and XXXX a chance to rest and heal. I have read that only 30 % of people survive this treatment. I was very lucky. I was in a XXXX   until late XXXX, and then in long-term acute care until the end of XXXX. My last couple of weeks were spent in XXXX  working on regaining my ability to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was released from rehab on XX/XX/XXXX. 

My JP Morgan Chase credit card account was due on XX/XX/XXXX. At that point, I was in XXXX XXXX  and being placed on life support. It was thirty days late on XX/XX/XXXX, while I was still in the XXXX. As soon as I was awake and responsive, I worked with my family to take care of my financial obligations. My account was paid and made current by XX/XX/XXXX, even though my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and I remained in XXXX XXXX. My account was reported to the credit bureaus as 30 days delinquent in XXXX. 

My mortgage company notified me of the derogatory report. I immediately contacted JP Morgan Chase to request they remove the delinquency. I spoke to a customer service agent on XX/XX/XXXX, who was unable to help me. She said that the company is required by law to make accurate reports to the credit bureaus. The implication was that they can't legally remove it, but I know that isn't true. Next I spoke to a credit bureau specialist. She was very sympathetic, but said that JP Morgan Chase is only able to remove reports if they are factually incorrect. 

Next, I went to XXXX and a customer service agent reached out. The answer was the same, "" Please know, banks are required by federal law to report accounts to the credit bureaus. '' The agent gave me the customer service number and told me to ask for the Credit Bureau Specialist Unit, and that I may want to ask for a supervisor. Neither were able to help me, saying they can't remove a credit bureau report because of health reasons. I asked the supervisor if there was an ombudsman I could speak with, or if I could communicate with her supervisor, and she said no. 

So, I am complaining. The reason for my complaint is that I did not receive my bill, and the reason or that is because I was in a coma. I am frustrated that Chase will not work with me. I am annoyed that every Chase employee I spoke to deliberately tried to mislead me by insinuating that federal law prohibited them from helping. Please help CFPB, I have no where else to turn. This could cost me thousands of dollars. If necessary I can provide documentation supporting my claim."

Although I am willing to pay my debts, they will not work with me to establish a reasonable payment plan for my current income. Furthermore, they know I have no immediate family to help me understand my liabilities and the Chase calls have been both confusing and misleading to me. Chase has been purposely trying to get me to verbally agree to something I can not possibly fulfill for a monthly payment. I also feel that Chase has treated me unfairly because they have been harassing me with collection calls, even though I have opted out of phone calls. Because of the harassing calls from Chase, I felt pressured into finding a financial solution ; and as a result, I was scammed by a debt consolidation company, leaving me further destitute. I reported to Chase that I was the victim of a credit consolidation scam by a company called net Debt. They led me to believe they were debt consolidators, not debt negotiators. They promised to pay my creditors off in XXXX years but all they did was take my money and left me with nothing. All Chase has done was continue to harass me by their relentless phone calls XXXX times a day including Saturdays and Sundays, even though I opted out of phone calls.

I told them that this was also untrue that it made no sense for me to make such a request since the check had already been located by them and the amount placed on my account following established procedures during the established twelve hour window. 
I also told Chase that I was formally asking for my original request to be continued so that the check would be found and the amount in question be placed into my account. 
To back this new solicitude, I offered to go to any of their branch offices on the following day and identify myself with adequate ID so that this process would be continued. 
They denied this request giving as a justification that the time limit for such an investigation had passed. 
I told them that this was not my fault that this had occurred that I had responded to the situation as soon as I had found out that the {$200.00} had been withdrawn from my account. 
They told me that they were sorry but that they were denying my request and suggested that I contacted the issuer of the check and ask them to cancel it and reissue a new XXXX. 
I told them that this was an inconvenience since this would require some time and I needed the sum to pay my rent before the end of this month and that I did not know whether the check in question had been cashed by a third person."

I did this for 2 reasons ... 1. I am now a retiree and I wanted to reduce my monthly outgoings and 2. I wanted to improve my credit score as I am about to purchase a new car ; I wanted to finance this. 

I paid off my ~ $ XXXX mortgage and my $ XXXX HELOC with Chase and I paid off my $ XXXX Auto Loan. I still have another auto loan ( ~ $ XXXX ), a 0 % interest credit card with about $ XXXX outstanding, my XXXX XXXX XXXX and I have no serious delinquencies. 

My initial complaint was with Chase as they were still reporting my ~ $ XXXX HELOC as outstanding nearly 2 weeks after I had paid it off and this was affecting my credit utilization which was at 51 % before the loan payoff was acknowledged ; this gave me a credit score of around XXXX. I applied to XXXX XXXX for an auto loan for my new car and I was turned down flat by every lender. I was told that my credit utilization was too high. I complained to Chase and the Credit Reporting Agencies that old data was being reported and this was detrimentally affecting my ability to borrow money and Chase fixed the reporting on their end. 

I didn't need my HELOC anymore and I was not going to use this for my Auto Loan as the interest is too high and it's an adjustable rate. Chase asked me if I wanted to close the account which, of course, I did as the account is redundant. Nobody warned or advised me that this could have a damaging effect on my Credit Rating. 

Once XXXX  acknowledged that the loan had been paid off, they sent me a mail alerting me to a change in my credit score. I had paid for credit monitoring and I logged into my dashboard to find that my credit score had dropped to XXXX. I called XXXX to discuss this and I was told that the act of closing my HELOC was/is viewed negatively but they were unwilling to explain why. 

I have an excellent ( 24 year ) record of responsible borrowing and on-time payment. I now own my house free-and-clear ( ~value $ XXXX ) and my current car ( ~ $ XXXX ) and I have liquid assets of around $ XXXX and semi liquid assets XXXX investments ) of around $ XXXX. 

Why did Chase not warn me of the potential negative outcome of closing my HELOC account? 

Why am I being penalized for paying off my debts? I can now no longer borrow money at all. If I could borrow, it would be at exorbitant rates of interest. 

How can this be fair or even legal? 

Why are people not given clear information on what affects their Credit Ratings so that they can make the appropriate decisions? I would not have closed my HELOC account if I had known that this would cause my credit score to crater.

It seems that I am being blackmailed into staying in debt to avoid my credit rating being damaged ... this is extortion."

I paid the settlement agreement in full and received a tax form for the written off portion of balance that I paid taxes on. In XX/XX/XXXX I called Chase and offered to pay the remaining portion of the balance that was written off so they would update my account to 'Paid in full ' as opposed to settled. They agreed and took my payment and updated the verbiage on account. What they did n't tell me is they re-opened the account status for credit reporting status to show late payments of 120 days plus for almost 2 years prior to the payment of the amount in XX/XX/XXXX. I specifically asked the agent at the time of offering to pay back the portion that was already settled and written off if this would jeopardize my reporting on credit in anyway and they assured me it would not. I remember specifically asking them if it would because I would rather not pay that portion and leave the account be if it would cause further issues. Basically they updated the verbiage but then updated my account with credit bureaus to make it look like I had an outstanding balance with them that was rolling XXXX plus day late payments for almost 2 years. The account would have been removed from my credit profile at this point but they say it will stay on until XX/XX/2019 which is XXXX years from the date I called in and made the payment to them just to update the verbiage on trade line. I did this because I work as a loan XXXX and wanted my credit profile to be as clean as possible. In attempting to better my credit and right a wrong Chase has extended the damage to my credit on an account they settled. My request is to have the account removed from credit profile as the account has not been active for over 7 years. They have been paid in full and I maintain a credit and checking account with them now with excellent history. I placed a dispute with XXXX and they came back and said Chase did not agree to remove. I have called Chase probably a dozen times over the past 3 years and tried to get them to help and the department that handles this told me they agreed with me and that the account should be removed but due to a dispute with another department on how it should be handled they cant remove it. This is been ongoing for XXXX years. They said it 's not high enough priority to get the dispute resolved internally on how it reports. This is damaging my ability to get low rates on credit and costing me money over their petty internal dispute it sounds like to me. Any help is appreciated.

I'm incapable of XXXX  for XXXX because of health issues and my age. The pandemic makes driving too risky for me. So I applied to receive an EIDL loan, and was accepted. 

A few weeks after I received the EIDL funds, Chase bank froze my personal account. A couple of weeks later they withdrew mymoney and closed the account. The operators I talked to said that I can only receive my money with documentation that I was in business prior to XX/XX/XXXX. As an XXXX XXXX I do have documents that I was in business prior to XX/XX/XXXX, but Chase will only accept avery specific set of documents. Documents that an XXXX  XXXX is not required to have. Tax documents aren't even on the list. Also, Chase will not provide me a written list of acceptable documents. I asked several different people at Chase and they refused to provide me a list, either printed out at the bank, by letter, or even by email. They were willing to read them out but were impatient when I asked them to slow down and let me write the requirements down. I don't know if I have a complete list. Nevertheless, after several operators have read me the list, it's clear that the documents that they require are not documents that an XXXX   XXXX  is required to have in order to operate his business legally. 

As an XXXX XXXX I'm not required to have a business bank account. I'm not required to get a DBA, an EIN, or a business license. I'm not required to have a letter from the Secretary of State dated prior to XX/XX/XXXX. I'm not required to have meeting minutes dated prior to XX/XX/XXXX. And I'm not required to have a letter from a CPA nor an attorney dated prior to XX/XX/XXXX. I am legally permitted to operate as an XXXX  XXXX without any of this documentation. Yet Chase bank has frozen my account, demanding that I provide these documents. 
Chase is freezing these accounts illegally. Congress named XXXX XXXX  as qualified to receive these EIDL funds. The law is clear. Independent Contractors qualify. 

I've been a XXXX  worker since XX/XX/XXXX. I've been a XXXX   XXXX  since XX/XX/XXXX. And I've driven with XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX. I have a letter from XXXX attesting to the fact that I've been an XXXX  XXXX with them since XX/XX/XXXX. The bank won't accept this documentation. I have tax documents : 1099s and my 1040. Chase won't accept this documentation. I have a letter from an attorney who has examined my documentationand has confirmed that I am a legitimate XXXX   XXXX. Chase won't accept this documentation. I have a copy of my EIDL contract with the SBA, showing that I qualify for this loan. XXXX won't accept this documentation. I have more than enough documentation proving that I've been a legitimate XXXX  XXXX since at least XX/XX/XXXX so I legally qualify to receive the EIDL loan.

I'm including these attachments. Filenames are numbered as follows : # 1 I'm including a pdf from the Senate ( The Small Business Owners Guide to the CARES Act ), which states on page 7 that Independent Contractors are eligible to receive an EIDL loan.

# 2 I'm including a pdf from the IRS defining XXXX XXXX. This document states "" that an individual is an XXXX  XXXX if the payer has the right to control or direct only the result of the work and not what will be done and how it will be done. '' This describes my relationship with XXXX, XXXX, and all other XXXX  corporations with whom I'm in a business relationship. 

# 3 I'm including a copy of the CARES act page 10 naming "" small business concerns '' as eligible to receive these emergency loans, which cites the Small Business Act ( 15 U.S.C. 632 ) for the definition of that term.

# 4 I'm including a pdf of Small Business Act ( 15 U.S.C. 632 ), which defines "" small business concern '' with the words "" independently owned. '' # 5 I'm including a copy of the loan agreement that I signed with the SBA, qualifying me to receive this loan.

# 6 I'm including a letter from XXXXthat confirms that I have had an XXXX  XXXX relationship with XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX. 

# 7 I'm including a letter from Attorney XXXX XXXX attesting that I have an XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
# 8a-h I'm including further documentation ( XXXX rental agreement through XXXX ) that confirms that I began driving with XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I'm including first week of the month contracts for the months of XX/XX/XXXX through to XX/XX/XXXX, but I have 38 in total, one for each week. I can provide all 38 if requested. 
# 9a-h I'm including pay statements from XXXX for the first week of the month between XX/XX/XXXX through to XX/XX/XXXX. 
# 10a-d I'm including tax documents ( Schedule 1099 ) from both XXXX and XXXX for the year XXXX. 
# 11 In the off chance that XXXX will accept this, I'm also including an EIN that I received from the IRS on XXXX for another XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX ) that I own. 
# 12 I'm including all 28 bank statements that show I have received continued payments from XXXX, XXXX, and other gig corporations ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX ) since XXXX of XXXX. 

# 13 And I'm including the letter that Chase sent me regarding this matter.

This mountain of supporting documentation should be more than enough proof that I qualify for this loan. Chase has no legal authority to limit the documentation to documents that an XXXX  XXXX is not required to have. 

The thing is they aren't even going after the loan money. I withdrew the EIDL funds and deposited it into a separate bank. Chase never asked for the funds back. They have frozen my personal money. 
This can't be legal. XXXX XXXX  were named in Congress as being qualified for these loans. And I'm not the only person this is happening to. There are discussions on XXXX and XXXX detailing people who have had this same problem. I'm sure thousands of people across the country are having the same problem that I am. But on the other hand, people are reporting that they were able to get their funds unfrozen with tax documents and letters from a CPA or an attorney. Yet Chase won't accept these from me. I feel as if Chase is singling me out because the first operator I spoke to didn't like that I received the EIDL money.

It seems apparent to me that Chase is acting on its own in a discriminatory fashion towards XXXX XXXX, other gig workers, and independent contractors in general. The documentation that Chase requires were not established by the SBA, the Treasury department, the Senate, or any other government agency. In fact I mentioned this to the last operator I talked to and she said they take discrimination claims very seriously and she would be sending me documentation so i could file a claim. I have not received this yet, and I don't expect to.

Chase is clearly acting in an illegal fashion. I need this resolved.

I need a cashier 's check in the amount of {$5200.00}. 
I also need a letter that I can provide to my creditors ( like my apartment office ) that any delinquency I had was because of the bank and not because of something I did.And I need the documents that I was promised about the discrimination claim."

CHASE MORTGAGE : Due to work relocation from XXXX to XXXX, we had to move and sell our house wherever the market was at the time. Unfortunately it was at bottom. Our appraisal came in so low that we were short the amount to pay off our 2nd mortgage, which was with Chase. We offered to refinance and carry the debt and continue to pay it when we move to XXXX but the collateral to that load was my home in XXXX. We negotiated with them that we 'd pay whatever we could at that time and since the govt was insuring these loans back then, they agreed to not process the closing of this account as a short sale. Unfortunately they DID process it as a short sale and I have n't been able to buy a home going on 6 years now as a result of that. It ended up being a scam. They got reimbursed by the Fed, and I got killed with a short sale. Why..? I never had a late payment on that loan, ever. I have 4 credit cards with Chase today, never"

The man who called me advised me that my debit card had been hacked, for the fourth time this year. He knew all of my information, new and old address, email, phone number, and he even knew that I had just gotten a new debit card recently. He asked for my pin, which I gave because I have had to provide my pin to Chase many times in the past and thought this was protocol. He then sent me two confirmation numbers via text and requested I read them back to him to confirm my account. I later found out that those confirmation numbers were used to open a digital wallet with my debit card number, ( I did not give this person my debit card number, he found that out somehow himself ). As soon as I got off the phone with this supposed Chase employee, an ATM withdrawal from my Checking was made in Georgia. I then called that exact same number back, was on hold for an hour, was supposed to be transfered to a specialist and got disconnected. The next day I woke up to many charges made in Georgia, mind you I live in XXXX, OH. I spent approixmately 11 hours on hold, was disconnected many times, before finally a day later I was able to file a claim. No one from Chase instructed me how to lock my account and my account was never flagged even the charges were made one after the other. I ended up with - {$900.00} in my account. Chase reimbursed me a week later, only to reverse the reimbursements two weeks after that without notifying me that the claim had been finished and they decided to deny my claim. I ended up having to re open my claim 3 times, I provided them with as much information as I possibly could. I faxed over my phone log and text log to show that this person called me. Basically Chase determined that since this person had my pin, it was not fradulent and refuse to do any more. I would like this looked into and would like to be fully reimbursed so I can close my Chase account. This is the fourth time my account has been hacked, so clearly Chase has a severe security issue.

To the customers knowledge, FIVE MONTHS LATER : the seller has NEVER presented nor has the seller provided any evidence that a SEWING MACHINE CABINET was EVER shipped nor has a SEWING MACHINE CABINET ever been received by the customer NONE whatsoever! Not a shred NOTHING whatsoever! No shipping documents, NO delivery documents, no receiving documents,,,,, NOTHING! 

Six weeks later not having received the order the customer notified the seller by email to please cancel the order. And as such the customer also requested Chase Visa to dispute the charge. As of today, five months later the cabinet has still not been received by the customer. 

For Chase the ethical business practice would have been to ; refund the amount charged to the Visa account to the customer and advise the seller to deal directly with  customer INSTEAD Chase made a conscience business decision to take the most slimy sleazy unethical business solution approach JP Morgan Chase Visa they could ponder up. JP Morgan Chase Visa made a conscience business decision defraud the customer : Chase made a conscience effort to bully and terrorize the customer : charging her several hundred dollars late charges and interest, terrorizing with threatening letters, turning customer in numerous times to credit bureaus for late payment, calling the customer all hours of the day and night several times a day, on numerous occasions out right lying to XXXX XXXX XXXX, again in essence using the sleaziest slimiest most unethical business practices they could ponder up Chase Visa is the douc bag. 

The customer has over the last several months accumulated several hundred documents of back and forth communications with Chase always yes ALWAYS I said ALWAYS within 24 hours, XXXX  Chase is taking the hear no see no say no approach anything to defraud and steal what they can from the customer in effort to cover up their incompetent initially mis handlings! 

As of today, the order still NOT received! 

AS FOLLOWS IS THE CUSTOMERS FINAL RESPONSE ( response 2 of 2 ) TO THE XXXX  Customer final response to the XXXX : XXXX Chase lied again to the XXXX, shame on XXXX Chase! 

Chase has continued to lie about the sequence of events, one outright lies after another outright lie about the sequences of events, one outright lies after lie after lie!!! 

I certainly did respond immediately virtually within minutes of receiving any/all Chase communication both email and mail ALWAYS without fail! To claim I didnt is another outright Chase LIE always a continuous stream of lies! 

ANYTIME Chase wants to polygraph I would welcome them versus me in fact I WOULD PAY FOR BOTH! Come out you sleazy cowardly chickens CLUCK CLUCK CLUCK lets make it happen! Cluck Cluck Cluck COME OUT YOU COWARDS!!! 

You lied to XXXX  claiming you mailed your response letter to the customer on Monday XX/XX/2020 when in fact WAITING until Friday XX/XX/XXXX to mail the customer response. YES, another example of Chase Visa sleazy unethical business practices! 

Why would Chase do that? Like I said another Chase slimy sleazy unethical business practice : knowing that the XXXX  closes all claims to XXXX  at five days if no counter response is made by claimant. By holding the customer response two days and knowing it would take an additional 3-5 business mail to reach the customer ( that would be 8 days ) they could deceive the XXXX  into closing the claim, another example of Chase Visa slimy unethical business practice! 

Chase Visa this is NOT going away! 

Lied to the XXXX  a flat-out bald face lies to the XXXX did not mail on the XXXX held 3 days before mailing! Slimy sleazy unethical business practice of Chase! Lied to the XXXX! AGAIN! 

Shame on XXXX Chase Visa. I actually believe and after reading this you will also believe Chase Visa draws straws to see which can fabricate the biggest outright lie. WOW, lying to the XXXX  SHAME on Chase! Shame on XXXX Chase!!! 

And yes, I did save the envelope with the postage date, for future reference. 

Chase had every opportunity to get this right reversing the charge LONG before the seller CLAIMED to have shipped the product. However, with malice of forethought Chase made the conscious CHOICE to shove it up the customers butt RATHER than taking the CONTRACTUAL, honest, and ethical action slimy sleazy unethical business practices! 

Why because it was easier to STEAL from the customer than to get the money back from the seller ( did I mention you could XXXX XXXX ) the simple solution months ago! In other words, Chase botched the dispute then attempt after attempt to cover up with a continuous stream of lies! 

Is Chase Visa criminally liable for constructive acts to defraud? 

I IMPLORE Federal and State Attorney Generals of all 50 states to go after Chase Visa for slimy sleazy unethical  immoral breach of customer contract practices! This should be more than a GREAT example of a massive class action, after what I have experienced, I have to believe this has happened to hundreds if not thousands of other Chase Visa victims. 

I DEMAND full RESTITUTION, a FORMAL letter of apology and a complete cleansing of my credit history not to mention charter assignation, slander, liable damages! all because of the slimy sleazy unethical immoral business practices of Chase VISA!

As of today, I have still NOT received the SEWING MACHINE CABINET for which Chase STOLE {$190.00} PLUS {$400.00} from me!

Had they done their job in the first place ( what they are contracted to do ) this scenario would never have occurred. Instead they lie after lie after lie bullying, threatening, and terrorizing customers! 

My credit rating once in the mid 800s never even remotely close to late payment for the most part always paying the entire balance PRIOR to receiving the statement all prior to CHASE terrorize and bully tactics! 

Bullying slandering character assassination collection calls late charges multiple lies to credit bureaus multiple lies to the XXXX,,,,, for {$190.00} sewing cabinet NEVER received! 
LIE AFTER LIE!!!! 

I am going to work very hard to post this every day to as many web sites as possible. I want the world to know how slimy sleazy terrorizing bullying slandering character assassinating unethical practices by slimy Chase Visa MY GOAL 50-100 A DAY! 
Did I mention seller is in XXXX?? Did I mention the seller was XXXX? 

However, I am sure that had nothing to do with Chases slimy sleazy unethical business practices. And YES,  XXXX Chase does know all that you now know! 

I do have a PDF of all 100 pages documentation and communications readily available PLEASE PASS ON at every opportunity you have, Thank You!"

I contacted my credit card company and they searched for the payment and had no record of that amount in any of their accounts. I called Chase back and asked to cancel the bill pay. The person told me that they couldn't because they got confirmation that it was received. I told them that it wasn't received and I wanted to cancel the transaction or dispute it. The person at Chase told me that I couldn't dispute it and that I had to work with my credit card company to find the payment. I told them that they can't find something that they never got. The Chase rep told me that they couldn't help and couldn't open a dispute for it. After spending several hours on the phone with Chase reps and reps from my credit card, I couldn't get any help. Finally I spoke to someone I know and they looked at the confirmation that Chase sent me. The trace number on the confirmation is supposed to start with the RDFI 's routing number. Looking it up, it doesn't match any bank. Even after speaking to someone at the Fed Reserve, the person confirmed that the trace number is wrong because the first part of it doesn't belong to any bank. After over a month of calling Chase multiple times, I was finally able to get someone to dispute the transaction. I still only have a temporary credit, despite this happening back on XX/XX/2018. There are so many things wrong with this situation. First, there is a Reg XXXX violation for Chase refusing to open a dispute regarding the transaction. Second, Chase is violating the NACHA rules for using an improper trace number. Lastly, there has to be a UDAAP violation for Chase taking customer 's money and not doing anything to get it back when it goes to no one. I have a friend who banks with Chase who recently had similar issues with Chase 's bill pay."

The transaction was done through XXXX but they advised me to dispute it with the card it was run on, Chase. When I did, they notified XXXX who then placed a hold on the funds of the merchant 's. XXXX months later, Chase then informed me they are closing it not in my favor, claiming I never provided proof, when in actuality I have submitted loads of proof and filled out a letter they sent. But they claimed I did not. They man was quite rude and I believe insulting me ( but was hard to tell if he called me names or not due to his lisp ) I then contacted XXXX who advised me that if Chase won't do anything, to take legal action against the merchant. I contacted them again and let them know I am prepared to do just that. She then offered to send my money back but not until XXXX releases the hold on the funds. XXXX tells me they are still waiting on Chase to make a decision and if it's in my favor the funds will be released to me and if not then the funds will be released back to the merchant. 
I then filed XXXX complaint, and received a call from Chase XXXX offices later that week. I advised her of all of this, but she was rude and continuing to claim I did not do what was asked of me and provide the needed proof. To move past her rudeness, I said to the point XXXX has the funds on hold regardless of what we're bickering about. She XXXX XXXX XXXX and I was told the exact same thing they told me before, just this time, someone from Chase was on the line to hear it. After XXXX explained to the lady from Chase Executive office they only need to respond advising it's in the customer 's favor then the funds will release back to my card. After an hour of taking XXXX 's time and going in circles, the Chase employee said she found the merchant also uses Chase bank and said the money must be lost somewhere in the Chase network and it's up to her to retrieve it. Again, after an hour of XXXX drilling it in to this lady 's head, she was under the impression that XXXX had nothing to do with it, despite the fact the have the money in question. 
Today, XX/XX/XXXX I called to follow up with the Dispute Dept and got the rudest people. I wanted to check the status and advise that I last heard they were looking in the Chase network for the money when XXXX explained to her they have the funds on hold, so if they take it out of the merchant 's Chase bank account, then they'd be taking it twice. The lady argued with me. I started to explain the entire story and when it came to when XXXX advised me to take legal action against the merchant, I was quickly cut off being told I said "" legal action '' and has to transfer me, the lady did not allow me to speak, and obviously was not listening. The supervisor got on the phone claiming how I made threats to take legal action against Chase and was not receptive when I was trying to explain that I never said that and the rep never gave me the chance to talk. I then told the whole entire story, in hopes for some sort of answer or indication she was listening, she just says "" ok, is there anything else I can help you with '' I then hung up. 
Chase representatives do not have the ability to listen and comprehend a problem, they are very anti-customer and it seems like they are doing everything they can to be against the customer when they should be helpful. They have made false claims and do not care when you try to explain to someone else. 
XXXX claims they are waiting on Chase to reply and Chase claims they are waiting on XXXX to reply. On my first go around with this dispute, Chase advised me they were closing it because the merchant replied, and only sent me the automated response but nothing from the actual merchant. It blows my mind that Chase belives that XXXX was the original merchant. All of this was explained on that XXXX call between Chase, XXXX and myself, but the Chase rep still argued, being against the customer continuing on about how I didn't provide the proof that I actually did. 
I am just appalled due to how they can be so against the customer and treat the customer with such disrespect."

Transaction amount was {$5800.00}. I have mailed the item to the buyer 's billing address with XXXX tracked service. A buyer 's signature was obtained by XXXX at the time of delivery. Chase - the bank-issuer of the buyer 's credit card - initiated an unauthorized transaction request. I have provided XXXX ( my account holder ) and XXXX supposedly forwarded to Chase all the requested transaction and shipping records, which clearly shown that I have mailed the product to the buyer 's billing address and buyer has signed for the package and XXXX checked his government issued picture ID on delivery. 
In about a month Chase reversed the original transaction and has received {$5800.00} back without any explanation!!!! 
XXXX reps confirmed that as a seller I HAVE SATISFIED all requirements for the involved transaction. XXXX reps also confirmed that the buyer 's bank ( Chase ) HAS NOT provided any information regarding the case. The buyer 's bank has to provide NO information on the transaction in question and XXXX would transfer money to the bank EVERY TIME the bank asks REGARDLESS of the evidences a seller provides. They specifically stressed this would happen EVERY TIME. 

Unauthorized transactions happen, but responsibility and risk have to be shared between the seller/buyer and banks of the seller/buyer. For transactions such as mine - when item is shipped to the buyer 's billing address ( recorded and confirmed by the buyer 's bank ) with buyer 's signature and ID check on delivery - the responsibility has to be clearly on the buyer and buyer 's bank, and not on the seller. Otherwise, ANY buyer can use his credit card and order ANY item online without a need to pay for it, regardless of what evidence the seller provides and regardless what the seller does. 

This practice is very unfair to online sellers and very dangerous for the credit card industry. I expect Chase to deliver the funds {$5800.00} back to my XXXX account and deal with the buyer directly.

XXXX, Oh XXXX To Whom It May Concern : Reference : XXXX business credit card account XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The above account was approved and began in XXXX of XXXX. As far as I can tell looking through the history of the account, it has never been late. 

In XXXX of XXXX, XXXX, my company was sold to XXXX and XXXX in XXXX Ohio. In XXXX of XXXX, I requested that the account be closed due to the sale of the company. I was told the final bill to close the account was {$130.00}. I paid the balance. I paid it on our company bank account that was closed by XXXX and XXXX and I had no idea the payment was returned. 

I was never notified by Chase that the payment was returned insufficient funds. In XXXX of last year, I saw an alert that my credit had changed. It was the first time I had any notice whatsoever of a problem with the above account. I immediately called customer service at Chase and was informed that my final bill had ballooned to {$470.00} with late fees and interest charges. After speaking with several people that were not helpful at all, I was transferred to a lady by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) who agreed the charges were uncalled for. She lowered my bill to {$360.00}. I paid it immediately on the phone with a credit card. Still unconscionable, but I had no choice since these unwarranted late notices had been reported to all XXXX credit bureaus. I could not allow my credit to suffer any further. After XXXX did everything she could for me, she transferred me to XXXX who represented herself as being "" in charge '' of customer service for Chase which seems very suspect since she did n't have a customer service XXXX in her body. She refused to repair the mistakes made from this situation to the XXXX credit bureaus on my behalf. 

The result is this : This account was open for 8 years with never XXXX problem. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars were run through that account in those 8 years. 

When the final payment was made to close the account and it was returned ; I was never notified by Chase. When the company was sold last XXXX, I deposited {>= $1,000,000} from the sale into a Chase Money Market Account. It is still there today. ( see attached ) There is no viable argument that they could n't find me to notify me. It also makes no sense whatsoever that I would n't want to pay my last bill on this account for {$130.00}. 

XXXX can only surmise that these are bank policies designed to rack up absorbitant fees and by also reducing XXXX scores with inaccurate data they force consumers to pay higher interest rates. 

I demand my credit be corrected to reflect my accurate payment history with your company. I should not be charged with late payments and face the resulting drop in my credit scores due to your negligent ability to notify me. Your own employee agreed otherwise she would not have adjusted the late charges.

Come late XX/XX/XXXX I realized I had yet to receive a bill and proactively called Chase Auto Finance where I was informed that I owed {$2200.00} and I should have received the bill weeks earlier. I asked for the bill to be resent so I could review the statement. In this process we found out that they had an old billing address. 

I always keep my billing address up to date on my credit accounts. My Chase account that I paid both my Auto Loan as well as a credit card I have with them, was up to date. It turns out my Chase account billing address online only pertained to my credit card and not the auto loan. I'm not sure how I was supposed to know that. Logic would suggest if I view and pay my bills through one Chase account, that if I update the main account billing that it would reflect across my accounts. 

Nonetheless, we corrected the address in their system and weeks went by where I received 2-3 "" change of address '' confirmation letters but never received the bill. I asked them if they could email me a copy and that I would be happy to resolve it if I could see the bill, which they said they were not able to do - it had to be done through mail. They couldn't explain why I wasn't getting the bill and eventually just turned my account over to XXXX XXXX for collections. 

The only logical answer to what was happening here was that they corrected my billing address which auto-generated the "" change of address '' letters that I received, but the change never reflected to the actual bill. The Post Office isn't a complicated organizational operation and if I was receiving the "" change of address '' letters, there's not reason I wouldn't also be getting the bill if they'd corrected it internally. 

I raised this issue with XXXX when they called me in XX/XX/XXXX and they were finally able to get me a physical copy of the bill. I received it 5 days ago and paid the balance in full today. 

I see this as an unfair practice on behalf of Chase of an online process that's not transparent, and an internal operational billing issue that I shouldn't be penalized for. As a matter of fair practice, it's not fair to expect someone to pay a bill over {$2000.00} without them being able to review the bill."

Their claims department had refused to give me a specific reason and basis for the reversal and is asking me to settle the matter with the other party in a court of law. 

The details of my case is listed below : On XX/XX/XXXX, my wife, transferred {$19000.00} from her chase checking account to my chase checking account. This transaction was NOT an online transaction and the transfer was done by visiting Chase Bank branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TX XXXX The transfer was done in the bank by a banker, XXXX XXXX. Both of us ( my wife and myself ) were present in the bank and XXXX, the Banker verified both our ID credentials and checking account debit cards. 
After proper validation and after the authorization by the Bankers superior XXXX, the Manager of Chase Bank branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TX XXXX, the transaction was authorized. I am attaching my checking account statement forXX/XX/XXXX as proof of the transaction. 
We my wife and me filed for XXXX under mutual consent in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I found that My chase bank account was frozen and I was not appraised of the same. 
The contact center refused to give me a valid reason and on visiting the Bank, I was told verbally that my wife disputed a {$2000.00}, online transfer which she had made using XXXX XXXX. I was told that the amount is under investigation and till the investigation is over, my account will remain frozen. 
The Bank never sent me any communication and didnt allow me to present my side in this case. I was not informed of the nature of the complaint nor was I informed of any other details. 
My account remained frozen for next 2 months and on XX/XX/XXXX, I found that they had unfrozen my account. However, they reversed {$19000.00}. I received a letter from bank that they are reversing the money as they made an error in processing an ATM withdrawal. ( scanned copy attached for reference ). 
I raised the complaint with the Bank Executive office on XX/XX/XXXXand an associate named XXXX had recorded my complaint ( Case No # XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX called me on my cell number and informed me that as per the Bank it was an online transfer ( attached is the Bank statement for XX/XX/XXXX which shows the transaction as an online transaction ) which was disputed by my wife and Bank will not reverse the transaction. Now they have advised me to take the case in a court of law against my wife. 

Chase bank has failed to give me any information during the whole ordeal. They have failed to do the due diligence and investigate the case correctly. The transaction was a legitimate transaction, which was done in the bank, with the help of a banker. The banker had verified our IDs and the transaction was sanctioned by the Bank Manager. On three occasions, the bank has faulted in identifying the transaction In the letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ( attached ) they claimed that it was an ATM transaction error, secondly, in the verbal communication by XXXX from Chase Bank executive office and in the account statement, they called it an online transaction and thirdly I received a letter datedXX/XX/XXXXthey claimed it was a check deposit, while in reality, it was none of these three. 

Chase bank dishonored a legitimate transaction and betrayed me as a customer. They took a decision on my bank account without giving me any reason on the claim and took money out of my account and gave it to the third party and then asked me to take it up in the court of law. 

I believe the unauthorized transaction was a clear breach of trust and a breach of fiduciary responsibility of the bank. Given the above account of my ordeal, I request you to take this up with the bank and ask them to correct their mistake and give me my money back and credit {$19000.00} into my account at the earliest, reverse any fees that has been levied to my account post XX/XX/XXXX for overdraft. I request the bank to honor the legitimate transaction of {$19000.00} done in the branch on XX/XX/XXXX and honor my rights as a customer.

I have been a customer with Chase for over   XXXX   years and recently decided to discontinue all my accounts totaling over $  XXXX  as I do not have faith in my banking services with them any longer.     On  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX   I deposited a cashiers check in the amount of {$4800.00}. I have never had experiences with cashiers checks. It was from a vendor for a business transaction. I waited until  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX   to withdraw the monies from my account. I spoke with  XXXX   XXXX  prior to the withdrawal. She was my banker at the  XXXX   XXXX  branch in  XXXX   XXXX . She reassured me that the cashiers check had cleared and that I could withdraw the monies. Which I did.     That SAME evening I got a letter from Chase Bank dated  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX   indicating that the check was returned due to it being altered/fictitious. I was absolutely appalled!! I had JUST been in the bank that day and  XXXX  had reassured me the money had cleared, how was it possible for this letter to be sitting in my mailbox the whole time and for her NOT to see it was fictitious on her computer screen??!!     The next day I confronted  XXXX  and she contacted her supervisors and couldnt give me an answer. She directed me to  XXXX  in customer claims escalation   XXXX   claims center on  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX  , who also said there was nothing he could do. I asked him why the teller couldnt see that the check was fraudulent, and he said thats because the fraud department is separate and it can happen that the bank doesnt see it. Again I was absolutely disgusted. I told  XXXX  I would have to close all my accounts. She could do nothing because she was not a  XXXX  and her  XXXX  was out of town.     I was directed to  XXXX   XXXX  branch  XXXX  at the  XXXX   XXXX  branch.  XXXX   XXXX  at least was sympathetic to my plight and attempted to directly send it up the chain to customer escalation again. This time, it was sent to  XXXX   XXXX  on  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX  . I once again had to explain my story and she appeared empathetic but after a few weeks came back claiming there was nothing she could do.. I asked if the bank was insured for such events but she said because I signed the cashiers check I took full responsibility. I once again reiterated it was the teller who had the screen in front of her who didnt see that the check was fraudulent and reassured me the check had cleared so that I believed her. At this point I had no faith in Chase Bank with all my monies.     My final attempt at trying to recuperate my relationship with Chase was by asking  XXXX   XXXX  to give me airlines miles with my  Chase  credit card accounts. She again escalated the situation this time to  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  whom I spoke with on  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX  . On  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX  ,  XXXX   XXXX  also advised me that Chase was not even willing to give me miles to recuperate our relationship.     At this time, I am in the process of closing all my accounts with  Chase.  They include a private checking and savings account, a home mortage, a business checking account, several business and personal credit cards which total over $  XXXX . I feel I have done my due diligence to maintain a relationship but Chase Bank obviously doesnt value their respected clients. As of note I was a private client at one time too. I dont feel I can trust Chase Bank and they are not vested in the well beings of my money with such actions. I can go take my hard earned money elsewhere, where I am respected. Shame on you Chase Bank!"

Nope it screwed me I'm still screwed I'm still backed up on bills I had to apply for a new bank just because my account was so backed up this is not fair. The check was supposed to be for {$400.00}, I go to check it it says {$1200.00} they said okay just mobile deposit it once it clears send me the rest of the money back. Clearly wasn't thinking right because nobody has ever scammed me before but it happened and I'm sure they have bank account numbers hopefully not my social or anything of that kind. Please do something about this because I am in debt because of this! I even wrote to Chase Bank it was a JPMorgan check.

I did not give anyone my card or my PIN number and my phone and wallet was also stolen. 

My Pin was the code to my phone so whoever stole my debit card already knew the code to my phone. I never shared my PIN number so they must've been someone I knew personally. 

The person has to be one of my old care-takers, my wife had to fire a few of them because they were caught stealing other things from our room in the past.

I used the streamline FHA re-fi program and had to go elsewhere because Chase kept trying to find ways to jack up fees that were not allowed, or were unethical, and in some cases outright misleading. 
So, I did re-fi and thus Chase had no reason to keep private information on me. 
A few months ago I applied for an Amazon credit card and did receive it. I did NOT know they used Chase but nevertheless, I decided to keep the card. 
NOW I am trying to set up an ONLINE set up so I can pay ONLINE and access my credit card account -- charges, credits past statements etc. But I CAN NOT SET THIS UP BECAUSE MUCH to my dismay, Chase has kept private information from my mortgage and 1 ) it has the wrong old not used phone number and 2 ) an ancient email. So Chase needs to send a "" code '' to either a text, email or phone to confirm your account. Despite them having my account number, and all NEW UPDATED phone numbers and emails, THEY HAVE ONLY THE OLD phone number and email and there is no way to change or update it. 
I called twice, spoke to XXXX people, and NOBODY I talked to was able to CLEAR OUT the old information. I told them I was very displeased they would have the nerve to keep my private information. Then, they ca n't seem to get rid of it. 
Then the second man transferred me to someone in the department which is supposed to be able to do this and THAT man said there is a "" tool '' he uses but that "" tool '' is n't available to him now to be able to clear out or update information. 
OH PLEASE. 
Chase also uses stupid, ancient things like, what is your mother 's maiden name -- identifiers I have LONG AGO LONG AGO stopped using because these are so common and too many people know my mother 's maiden name. 
This is overall a problem with these banks who think they can just keep all sorts of information on people despite nobody doing business with them. Ever since I re-financed and have a much much better mortgage company, I have not contacted Chase for anything. No reason to keep my private information."

So I called Chase and they claimed it is their policy not to report any business cards to the XXXX companies unless the person falls XXXX days delinquent on the card. I explained that it is my card for my business, a sole proprietorship. I said there is a payment history there I want on my report because it is perfect and I am trying to build better credit for myself. They refused to add the card to my credit report. 

I explained that I have another business credit card from XXXX XXXX # XXXX and it appears on my credit report. Chase did n't care. They refused to do what I asked. 
That Chase bank is picking and choosing which cards they would like to report is unfair and is affecting my credit score. It seems like it may even be illegal. That Chase will report the card when your credit is bad ( XXXX days delinquent ) but NOT report the card when I have excellent credit is also unfair. I 'm not sure what to do. Are they breaking federal law? They certainly are not serving the customer with this policy.

The account was opened using the tax ID of my business and a credit check using my social security number. The account was opened in XXXX and had a limit of {$5000.00}. 

I used the card a lot - but paid consistently over the past almost 4 years, paying hundreds of dollars off. 

In XX/XX/XXXX I was out of the country on business. Chase tried to contact me when the account was over 30 days past due. When I got back, I called them to set up a payment arrangement to get back on track with payments. 

The first payment did not go through. Chase claims the funds were not available - but they were. Payment was for {$150.00} - I had over {$7000.00} in my other linked account. Usually chase will post the payment then I transfer the funds over. In fact - they ALWAYS do this. This time, they did not. 

Instead when I called them they claimed the payment was presented 3 times. I was not made aware of this by chase. If so I would have immediately transferred the funds over to cover the payment. 

The second payment of the arrangement went through, but by then it was too late. Chase closed the account ( I STILL have not received a formal letter or email informing me of this ) instead I found out when my credit score went down over 100 points because they reported this business account to my personal credit report. 

I believe Chase is TOTALLY in the wrong about this. Their failure to communicate is unfair and unjust. My credit report - which has high balances held for a period of time but accounts are paid on time always ... went from close to a XXXX to a XXXX in one day. Also, because the account is now closed if I did want to pay off the entire balance and use it for my business again, I can not.

I have been banking with Chase for over 20 years. I am shocked at this treatment by them to a loyal customer who has banked thousands with them over the years.

So i ask you, even when i signed a contract, but if the person refused to do the work, I would still have to pay her? Chase did not have their customers interest at their heart, and did not even try, especially when I have all the proofs that she did not deserve the money.

I filed charges against this person for impersonating me and stealing thousands of dollars through 3 credit cards of mine, Chase, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX. Two of these cards, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX cleared the fraudulent debt immediately with no trouble, but Chase has continued to improperly report this debt to intentionally damaged my credit report through false reports. I have attempted to resolve this issue for more than a year on my own to no avail. The Chase card "" investigators '' of the fraud claim have fabricated information making such claims as I provided access to these cards on my own free will, allowed the ex to use them, and even that I was liable because we co-habitated making this a civil matter. I have asked them for documentation to show me where this evidence was gathered, but they refuse. I have never allowed this ex to use my cards and made it clear she took them without my permission, yet they filed reports that it was consensual and permission granted. 
I have asked for copies of their card agreement with the section highlighted showing me where this would be considered civil as a basis for this decision and they refuse ( I presume because it does not exist ), and have even asked for a copy of my agreement to where I signed this agreement binding me to these terms and contract, to which one was never been provided, either electronically or through the mail. 

At no time was the person who stole this money given permission to access or use my credit cards, thus resulting in XXXX XXXX XXXX with my local police department of identity theft and credit card fraud. I have provided these police reports to Chase who refuses to accept them. Instead, Chase insists this matter is civil as a way to avoid honoring their fraud guarantee they promote in solicitation of their cards. When asked how I am not protected on this fraud protection guarantee, they continue to state their review has resulted in the investigation being deemed civil. Chase is knowingly damaging my credit for a debt they have been provided proof is not the result of my actions. They refuse to accept these documents and are the only company I have had any issues with as a result of this fraud. I have provided disputes to the credit bureaus and XXXX XXXX deleted the entry, yet XXXX and XXXX   continue to report this charged off card as valid because they state Chase has provided them responses that the debt is valid. In just XX/XX/XXXX Chase falsely reported to XXXX that the police report provided to them as proof of the fraud was in of itself a material misrepresentation! 

Chase will stop at nothing to cause me damage on my credit in an attempt to force me to settle on this debt which is entirely a fraudulent account. I have no other late payments or derogatory marks on my credit history other than Chase. I have threatened Chase with legal action, to which the representative literally laughed stating I was bound by their arbitration agreement and they would choose the arbitrator and I would have to pay, so "" good luck ''. I understand this clause is an attempt to save time in the court system, but it is also to make it impossible to provide a fair trial in front of a judge. I then suggested Chase should simply sue me in court if they felt it was a justified debt, because I would never repay this debt and would be happy to explain this in front of a judge who would dismiss their case. Naturally, Chase refuses to accept this offer because they know they can not win as my evidence and officers who took the fraud report and investigators working the case can testify to the legitimacy of the fraud. 

The attempt by Chase to prevent me from having this account deleted is purely for intentional damage to my financial health as well as to harass me to try to get me to break and settle this debt. Since I have attempted all other solutions, I am reaching out to your office for assistance in this matter. Chase is quite literally keeping me hanging in limbo and chooses not to take any actions of collection or court proceedings knowing they will lose, but also refuses to accept the documentation that this account was the result of Fraud. So at the suggestion of an investigator at the XXXX, NC police department, I am filing a complaint with your office with the hopes of finding some type of resolution to this matter. It is obvious Chase knows they can not be sued by me and thus are using the Davis  vs. Goliath mentality to push my back against the wall and try to blackmail me into paying them money to restore my credit. I refuse to cave into their intimidation tactics and lack of moral and questionable legal tactics and would to please like to request your assistance on this matter. If a police report with XXXX XXXX XXXX listed is not enough to provide proof of the legitimacy of this case, what is?"

6. The man who supposedly hacked my account is named XXXX XXXX. A BASIC name search shows no XXXX XXXX residing in the United States.

However, they instead try and steal money from my account rather than do their jobs. Lastly, I would like to close with a logic question.

It is at the term end, and we decided to renew the line. When I received the information regarding our credit scores, I knew they were incorrect. 

Chase noted they had used Equifax as their credit score provider. I ran both my husband 's and my Equifax scores and found discrepancies between the scores Chase reported and our actual credit scores. Chase reported my husband 's XXXX score as XXXX. The XXXX score I ran was XXXX. Chase reported my score as XXXX. The XXXX score I ran was XXXX. That is a 24 point difference for my husband and a 41 point difference for me. Just as a reference, I also pulled my FICO score which was XXXX, which is still a 27 point decrease. 

I inquired why the scores were so drastically different, and the Chase representative stated they used the XXXX score and then factored in the loan we had yet to take. This means the score Chase reported to us was NOT an XXXX score. It may have been loosely based on an XXXX score with a Chase specific algorithm applied? Although if that were the case, the scores should have been affected equally not a three percent decrease for my husband and a five percent decrease for me. 

Chase uses credit scores to determine interest rates and terms. The differences in credit scores mean a difference in loan terms. An "" excellent credit score '' may be prime plus .25 %, and anything less than that may be prime plus .33 %, .50 %, .75 %, etc. That can be tens of thousands of dollars over the course of a loan. 

While this artificial deflation may not affect those people solidly in the center of the credit score brackets, it significantly affects those on the bubble. For example, if the true credit score is XXXX, which is the bottom of "" fair credit, '' the artificial deflation would sink the score into "" poor credit '' which will garner a higher interest rate or possibly a loan rejection."

I understand Chase closed many branch offices due to Coronavirus issue, However I was not given an opportunity to retrieve my valuables before the bank closed.

They told me to go into the branch and have them approve the override and to tell them to call consumer services to reopen the card I had that was originally giving me problems and the card I ordered on the XXXX was still being processed. Went into the branch and no one could help me. The personal banker told me to leave the branch or she would call the police on me that she could no longer help me. I told her to go ahead and to give me the district managers number because my card that I had was closed and all the cards I ordered have never been received or even shipped. And no one was held accountable for giving me the run around. It feel distrimated and be little by them. To be told they would call the police is a big threat I was n't violent or yelling simply want to resolve this issue before I go out of town next week.

Dear FCC ; I purchased a new XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. Within 2 weeks it displayed a known bubble defect. I tried to return the phone. Now, mid XXXX, almost 4 months later XXXX offered to send me a new refurbished phone. ( see FCC complaint # XXXX ) I could not go 4 months without a phone so I had already purchased a new XXXX. ( Their offer to replace a phone that was defective at the time of purchase with a refurbished model is not a fair or reasonable offer due to the great delay in processing and the fact that I had to replace the phone in the interim. I do not want or need XXXX phones. ) I was promised XXXX service. I was immediately troubled with numerous dropped calls within the first two weeks. I made numerous calls to technical support, then followed XXXX instructions to go to the store for assistance. At the store, employee XXXX spend XXXX and a XXXX on the phone with technical support, pretending to be me, which is what she said they had to do. She and the other employee at the store told me that a tower was going to be constructed by the XXXX XXXX by where I lived and showed me that they too were only getting XXXX bar and no XXXX service. They said the area affected was XXXX to XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX suggested that maybe I needed more memory on my phone. I later purchased XXXX memory, but my calls continued dropping and I continued calling technical support. Although they repeatedly promised to escalate my complaint, the calls continually disconnected when they told me they were transferring me. Customer service informed me that there was a tower in my area that was almost completed. When I suggested that perhaps construction might be interfering with coverage, they admitted the tower they had claimed was almost completed had not yet begun construction. 
The representative promised me a credit for service for XXXX and XXXX which would be {$110.00}. In XXXX, although my account was auto deducted {$55.00} for phone service, XXXX cut off my phone service. I then attempted to XXXX my phone number to another carrier. XXXX refused to release the number. They claimed I had not paid the bill, which had been paid by auto payment the day prior. I had a job interview on the phone that morning so I paid the bill under protest so as not to miss my job interview. By this point, it was clear that my phone now had XXXX memory, when I traveled to XXXX or XXXX I received XXXX and XXXX bars of service, but upon returning home to XXXX and XXXX I still had no G service, XXXX bar and my calls continued to drop. 
I traveled out to XXXX and had no coverage for XXXX days and was lost in a forest fire area due to loss of GPS service and complete cell phone coverage. I had none of the service promised an"

The request went through and I was able to print a copy of the wire confirmation with a transaction number. 

I waited several days but the wire did not reach the recipient. I called customer service on XX/XX/XXXX and was told the wire "" was being held by the fraud department '' and the line was transferred. The person from the fraud department said he did not see anything on my account and there was "" no record of any wire '' on my account. I offered to give him the transaction number or send him a copy of the receipt. However, he did not want to even consider that and said i have to send a secure message by logging into my account and somebody would be able to help me. I asked to speak with his supervisor who also said the same thing. She also warned me not to record the conversation. She said "" XXXX does not allow phone conversations to be recorded by customers ''. I asked her if the conversation was being recorded at her end - she said yes! So, XXXX records calls at its end but does not allow customers to record conversations. 
Anyways, as requested, I sent a message through the "" secure message service '' by logging into my account. I also attached a copy of the receipt. I received a response the next day asking me to call a number saying they would be able to help me. 

When i called that number on XX/XX/2021, the person said she did not see any record of any wires from my account on her system. By this time I was very frustrated and concerned about the integrity of the systems at this supposedly "" too-big- to-fail-bank ''. How is it possible that the bank was unable to even see a record of a wire transfer request that was made about two weeks ago? 

I said i was going to bring this matter to the notice of regulatory agencies. At that point, the rep said since i had raised the regulatory word, she was going to escalate the matter to someone. This someone "" supervisor '' came on the phone and mysteriously found the record of the wire. She then said the wire did not go through because of a "" system glitch ''. She then said she was going to cancel the transaction and that I was going to have to try again. Really?!! Rinse, repeat?? 

After i hung up the phone, I received a message saying that the wire had been cancelled at "" my '' request. What a bunch of jokers and liars!! 

It appears this is what happened : The bank screwed up with sending the wire due to some glitch in their system. Instead of admitting the problem, they tried to pretend that the wire was never sent by me and lie their way through hours of phone calls. When the level of customer frustration reaches the level of bringing regulators into the matter, then a supervisor admits to the mysterious problem. However, instead of correcting the problem, they then just cancel the wire and send the customer a email saying the customer requested for the wire to be cancelled!!! 

As a way intimidating the customer and to prevent any evidence from being preserved, the supervisor also says "" chase does not consent to or approve of recording the phone call ''. 

To me, the above is not just an issue of callous customer service. It points to perhaps a much bigger and systemic problem at the bank where its internal systems are failing and they are trying to intimidate customers from preserving evidence and bringing the matter to the attention of the regulators and the general public. 

I request the concerned regulators to please look into the systems of this "" too big to fail '' bank."

My mortgage company then filed the appropriate documents which were affidavit confirming that the endorsement on the check was not their endorsement. JP Chase states that they are willing to return the said funds but claim that they will only do this if my mortgage company send them documents of my mortgage history. My mortgage company advised me against such an agreement stating that the affidavits from them should be sufficient enough to have the said funds returned and that what JP Chase bank is attempting is illegal. It is my belief that JP Chase is aiding and abetting the crooked contractor who believes that the unauthorized work he completed on my home should be offset from his fraudulent activity. In fact JP Chase refuses to communicate to my mortgage company as to why they are requiring my mortgage history. I know that the crooked contractor threatened to file a lien on my property if he did n't get paid which he is allowed to do on his own accord, but it looks as though he has involved his bank JP Chase in his criminal activity. He is more than welcome to file a complaint with his attorney for the unauthorized and shoty work he has done to get this situation resolved. JP Chase Morgan Bank is attempting to extend the process by asking for my mortgage history which they were aware my mortgage company would not agree to therefore causing a stalemate situation. My mortgage company believes that once JP Chase Morgan is in reciept of my mortgage history they will release the check fund to their client."

I strongly requested signing she kept refusing. She raised voice at me in public in the main area of the branch office. Many people witnessed that very ugly quarrel. Finally I was forced to give up and I left the branch without the signed document. I hope I dont need to explain how upset, insulted and humiliated I felt.

Was my request really something illegal or unusual? I have to say also that Ive never been treated in any business place like that written above.   The situation, which Ive described above brings impression that the Chase bank doesnt care much about its customers, because some of Banks employee miss the basic skills, neither training to deal with customers, act very unprofessionally ; having no idea how they need to treat the Banks customers.     The worst is that I still do not have idea why I had been exposed to all of that stress. Why the person, who made important work for the customer was so stubborn and rude and kept refusing to the end, signing that job was done properly. I can not believe that."

I received two late payment reports for two separate JP Morgan Chase credit cards in XX/XX/2020 : A personal Chase Freedom credit card and a business credit card. I wrote a letter to dispute these late payment reports in their entirety and to have them removed from my credit reports. During the periods of XX/XX/2020 XXXX I went through financial hardship due to Covid-19 and its restrictions. I was told by a Chase employee my credit card accounts can be signed into their credit card relief & Forbearance program ( Appendix B ) and that I can receive covered accommodation which I accepted. During this period all credit accounts were paid and current as outlined in 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ( F ) ( iii ). I was told that under Chase accommodation program I could delay up to three payments on my personal or business credit cards since I had been affected by COVID-19. I was told during the relief period I would get : Statements showing no minimum payment due Refunded Late Fees No negative reports to credit agencies regarding late payments Still there was a mistake and were late payments were reported for both credit cards which is against Chases accommodation program and Terms and Conditions for credit cards in their accommodation program. Chase Credit Card Terms & Conditions for Covid accommodations. I am reporting Chase bank had a clerical or computer glitch/error in their system and that my accommodation was somehow not registered. I brought this error up to Chase Bank and was told to correct the issue with the credit reporting agencies as, according to their employee, they do not have a process in place to correct this errors once reported regarding Covid-19. Because of this I am requesting that all late payments reported by Chase Bank in the month of XXXX be removed from my credit report and further request that any damage to credit which occurred by Chase Bank decreasing my available credit be correctly reflected/noted, in written statement - to be an error and a mistake by Chase Bank I paid off all my Chase credit cards but due to their reducing my available credit limit and retaliatory tactics to my choosing another bank as is a consumers right I was unable to qualify for another credit card despite having XXXX debt. I applied for credit cards and was denied further damaging my credit score. It fell from XXXX to XXXX because of this which I believe is all a single issue. Chase damaged my credit and reputation due to my leaving their bank and credit agencies have been less than helpful in communication with me to correct this problem."

At XXXX, another text came in with similar info for {$4900.00}, XXXX ET. At XXXX, the third text came in staying that a 3rd charge was made at XXXX ET in the amount of {$5100.00}. By the time the second text came in, I was logged in to my Chase account to look at the charges. I also noticed two other small pending charges that were also pending prior to the large charges. Both were under {$1.00}. There is limited information on where the charges came from- it only says XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX After doing a quick XXXX search, I found that this has to do with cryptocurrency, which I am not familiar with. 
On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ( so FOUR minutes after the first text came in ), I was on the phone with Chase ( @ XXXX ) to report the charges. The card was cancelled and I was told a new card with a new card number will be issued. The lady told me I needed to call the fraud department on Monday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to report the fraud since that department was closed on Sundays. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the fraud department to report the fraud. It wasnt until XX/XX/XXXX that I got a notice that the claim was denied. I again called in to the fraud department to find out why. I was then told that it was denied because charges were authorized since I called in to increase my credit limit. I immediately told them that I did NOT call in to Chase to authorize this. They also refused to give me any information as far as what the caller used as proof that it was me. I was told I cant have that information. I was then told that it would be looked into further and they would re-open the claim but I needed to provide proof that it was NOT me that did these charges. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a police report with XXXX County Police Department. I also filed a report with the FTC. I have put a fraud alert on my credit bureaus and put a freeze on them. I had a friend that knew of my situation with the bank and he messaged me with a contact at XXXX because he does have an account with them. I emailed them to see if they could be of any assistance. Those emails are included with the documents I later provided to Chase. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the fraud department again to provide the police report number. I was told that the claim was not open, despite what I was told on the XXXX. I was again told to provide proof that I didnt do these charges or it wont be approved. I also was basically accused of collusion and providing others with information to do these charges. I would like you to know that, without a doubt, I did NOT do these charges nor do I know who did. I certainly didnt provide anyone with information in order to make these charges. I did NOT call in, requesting the increase to {$30000.00}. The fraud department told me the caller said it was for business equipment. Also, I was told the caller called in at XXXX ET. This was the same time the first text came to me with the first charge. Also, with the exception of my one recent charge at XXXX restaurant, the card has not been out of my possession and I have my ID, SS Card and all other things with me. 
I alerted Chase in the most timely manner possible, within 4 minutes. Look at my history of charges. Look at my account, I have never purchased cryptocurrency before. I have never called in for a credit line increase. My TOTAL monthly charges are usually only a few XXXX dollars. I need this to get resolved and my money put back in my account. I have been with Chase ( previously WaMu ) since XXXX and I am very unhappy with the way I have been treated by the fraud department."

From the time I made the call to when It was completed, the time length was 1 1/2 hours. I first spoke to XXXX ( did not get her ID # ), then spoke to a XXXX ID # XXXX, then spoke to XXXX, ID # XXXX who finally was able to help me. She explained to me the two programs they have to offer. One was to defer one month payment, the other was a 5 year relief program. I chose the 5 year program. She told me that the interest rate would be lower, no fees, the account would be closed and paid off in 5 years. She then put me on hold and came back to say she had good news that the interest rate would be 0 %. She also asked me what payment amt would I be comfortable with, and I told her {$150.00}. She then asked me for my income and expenses. I told her I was not at home and would not have the exact figures, she said that would be OK. After I gave her the figures, she put me on hold, came back and asked what we pay for in health insurance. Not sure why she asked me this as it is already a deduction out of our paycheck. I also explained to her that I had figure our income wrong. I was figuring income based on 2 checks per month for each of us, when we really get 26 pay checks, not 24. She seemed to be confused on this, and left it as what had given her. After another hold, she came back told me I was approved, but the payment would be {$160.00}. I told her that would work. She then said she was going to pass this on to her supervisor for final approval. She then came back and said we were not approved, that our expenses are more than our income. I told her that was incorrect, and would be because of how I figured the income. She then transferred me to her supervisor. After waiting on the phone, still connected no one came on the line. This all took an hour & 15 minutes. I then called back got a XXXX ID # XXXX explained everything & how I was on hold and the supervisor never came to the line. She explained that they have a new phone system and would make sure her supervisor would come on the line. She tried to transfer but it was a bad connection. I then talked to a XXXX ID # XXXX in collections about how XXXX handle the process, told me I was eligible, then not eligible. Not correcting the income I explained to her. She said I would have to call customer service in 30 days to reapply for the relief program. So at this time I took a deferral for XXXX payment. 

My next payment would be due XX/XX/XXXX. I then called back on XX/XX/XXXX to discuss again our difficulty to make XX/XX/XXXX payment. But did not want to get 30 days behind. I first talked to XXXX ID # XXXX, explained why I was calling and we started talking, then the call disconnected. I called back talked to XXXX ID # XXXX, the call disconnected again. I then thought maybe it was my cell phone so called using my land line phone. I called back the 3rd time, talked to XXXX ID # XXXX, told her why I was calling and said there should be notes in the system from my call with XXXX ( the first one I talked to ) there were no notes. The call then disconnected. I called back the 4th time, on my land line, talked to XXXX, ID # XXXX and again the call disconnected. 

I then called XXXX on the same day, XX/XX/XXXX, the # I received from XXXX who was working on the first complaint I sent. I entered the 10 digit extension as it requested, I then received a message, "" not a valid entry ''. I called back, enter the ext again, recevd the same msg, but stayed on the line and got XXXX voice mail. I left her a message to call me. I then called back to the XXXX, did not enter the 10 digit extension and was able to speak to XXXX. I explained to XXXX my frustration. Calling trying to figure out help with our payment, called 4 x 's and every call disconnected. I told her someone could have called me back. She said that the number is not saved, unless in the conversation it was given to one of the reps to look up my info. Which it was given to the first person I talked to, which was XXXX, ID # XXXX. She said that she would leave a message for XXXX. I never did receive a call back from XXXX. 

I also shared with XXXX all the phone calls I received from Chase and how this is harassment at the least. Below are the following calls I received from XXXX. 13 calls in a 3 day period. then again today 4 calls, with two of the one after the other. If I am not mistaken it should be no more than 3 calls in a week, may not call repeatedly. She apologized and said she would definitely have XXXX call me. Which she never did.

I told him how XXXX was not returning my calls. He apologized and said he was now handling my complaint. I also explained to him my frustration with the customer service. Not being able to speak to someone regarding my payment and the repeated phone calls. 

Chase makes it next to impossible for the customer to get any help at all. Then harass with multiple phone calls, 13 calls in a 3 day period, with calls coming in one after the other."

My life is being affected yet again since even an employer checks your credit to offer you employment these days and I can't even get a credit card or buy a car, nothing because they have not reported this properly. Chase has taken me to court and asking for something like {$140000.00} or a lien on my property when I declared that debt in the banruptcy and it was discharged! I need these cleared up and my credit cleaned so I can have my life back! Never ever ever lend your credit to anyone and when you file bankruptcy make sure you sun your credit to ensure it is being reported properly. I have learned my lesson but fixing this is taking a long time and causing stress on my marriage and our family! Please help!"

I never signed a report that stated I was at 60 % nor would because I would not have been in agreement with XXXX report was changed to 60 % AFTER I signed the report at 90 % .... ( ILLEGAL )!!! 

2 ) Please see the report fromXX/XX/XXXX, which stated we were at 75 %, it also stated that windows need to be installed, siding needed to be applied to the house, insulation and sheet rock needed to be done. 

3 ) Since theXX/XX/XXXX report at 75 % - The following items have been completed : Hurricane Windows Installed, Siding Installed and Painted, Insulation Installed, Sheet Rock ( tape and skim coat ) Installed All of the items listed completed and have also passed inspection with the City of XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

4 ) Also please note that in the report fromXX/XX/XXXX states office, porch and deck. There has never been an office or a back porch on that house since the day I purchased the house. The deck was a 4 wide 10 deck that was actually a step up to the back door of the houseinsurance did not pay for this deck because it was an outside feature that was not a part of the claim.. The deck was termite infested so I had it removed and there will not be a Deck added back, just steps up to the back door. Whomever gave the inspection company the information regarding office, porch and deck gave wrong information, which wrongly affected the percentages of the XXXX report..unfortunately the report was written based on that incorrect information. 

5 ) The XX/XX/XXXX report was correct at the time regarding the 75 % and we have now completed many of the items that were listed on the XX/XX/XXXXreport, so we are certainly between 87 % and 90 %, that would be more accurate.

Please review all that I have written carefully..the XX/XX/XXXXreport was erroneous and also fraudulent regarding my signature, which that alone give way for a lawsuit from me the homeowner. I am 100 % disputing theXX/XX/XXXX report based on wrong information going in and the fraud that was committed with my signature by the inspection company.

I need to know who opened that Slate card and am curious if it's even legal to use information that far back that is not even on my credit reports as basis for terminating a credit line. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was living in public housing, working my XXXX off to take care of my kid after an abusive marriage. I now hold two XXXX   degrees and work for the most prestigious marketing agency in XXXX Florida - How do I get this fixed? Also, despite closing the account on XX/XX/XXXX, they put another inquiry on my report on XX/XX/XXXX that needs removal."

Concerns : -Do we use credit cards to pay them in full in one month?

On XX/XX/2019 a transaction of {$1800.00} transferred from my account through the XXXX money transfer system on XXXX. The amount was sent to someone named XXXX XXXX. I do not know who that is and I did not authorize that payment. I have filed a dispute claim to XXXX 's fraud team but they have denied it by saying according to their investigation, they can not prove fraud. But they are not taking into account the fact that another fraudulent tried to go through right after that transaction for the amount of {$1900.00}. For that amount, XXXX sent me an alert asking if I authorized it and since I had not, I denied it. XXXX refused to see that similar amounts were tried to be taken out within the same time frame and being sent to people with similar names. All money transfers I do on my account are to family members. You can clearly see that on my account. Also, I have been a member for over a decade now. If they were to analyze my account holistically then they could see that I have been on good terms with Chase all these years. 
On top of this fraudulent activity on Chase 's account, I have had other instances that have led me to believe my identity has been compromised. I have closed a lot of my accounts and placed fraud alerts on everything and froze my credit. I am terrified that another hack is going to happen that is going to compromise my identity further. But when I am telling all this to Chase 's fraud team they are refusing to listen at all. They keep repeating the same line that they have investigated and they can't prove that this is fraud. They are refusing to see it holistically or even to hear about my struggle. I don't know what else to do. This incident shows that there is a deficiency in Chase 's systems and also in the XXXX Payment system. Unfortunately, they are not giving this a thought at all. If this happened to me and Chase is not willing to investigate it further then they are giving power to the thieves who are getting away with stealing money from hard working Americans. As one of the leading financial institutions, Chase should be doing more to listen to the customers and their plight rather than training their employees to just repeat what's on their screen. Please help me understand what I should do next to get my money back and how to put those thieves behind bars."

The payment was to be sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX and the address we entered was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, WA XXXX.

Our account number and memo loan payoff for auto loan XXXX was also included in the memo section with this payment. Our checking account was then automatically deducted in the amount of {$21000.00} and the payment was to be effective on XX/XX/21. It is now XX/XX/21 and we have contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX multiple times however they claim they have not received this payment and they can not locate it anywhere regardless that we have provided them with a trace number to look up multiple times.

XXXX is claiming they do not have these funds and Chase is claiming the same. We need these funds located ASAP and somebody has to know where they supposedly are. How does a bank loose {$21000.00} like that and how is this ok? Why cant we get anymore information if an actual bank account this was deposited into? We cant seem to get any help no matter what we do. We have been told we can not open a claim or dispute by Chase for bill pay payments and then we were told we can. They have gone back and forth saying this all day. The trace number we have been provided from XXXX is XXXX and the transaction ID is XXXX. They can not provide any paper check or anything other than a proof of payment that basically provides the numbers above. I believe there was a mistake made with this payment and Chase needs to step up and help. These numbers we have been provided do us absolutely no good if we can not link them to a payee or exact bank account to determine who these funds went to and we do not have the capabilities to do so with just numbers provided by Chase. As of right now, Chase also will not do so or give us anymore information. They refuse to help us track these funds down or find out where exactly these funds were sent to. We just want this figured out so we can either get our money back or have the funds successfully applied to our auto loan at XXXX XXXX XXXX. We have literally exhausted all resources at this point so if we can not get this figured out ASAP we will have no choice but to contact a attorney and if we do so we will also be seeking damages for attorney fees from Chase.

The tickets we're for {$600.00}. ( A ) The event was XXXXXXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the concert was postponed due to Covid until XXXX of the following year. My daughter was not yet XXXX and I could accompany her to XXXX but the XXXX dates did not work for us. 

I called the company to get a refund but they said it was past the allotted time for a refund. ( 7 days ) They claimed they sent me an e-mail but the e-mail address they allegedly sent it to was not one I had, or ever had. 

I disputed the charge with my credit card company, Chase, stating I did not receive the service I paid for. XXXX XXXX, the concert name, sent information showing that I had the tickets so I actually DID receive what I paid for. Their PROOF was a receipt for a different dollar amount and for a person that wasn't even me! ( B ) It was for a person named XXXX who lived in New York. ( If you look at ( B ) you will see neither the dollar amounts, name, or dates match! ) Chase unfortunately STILL took their side because I had stated that "" I didn't receive the service '' Basically, that I filed the complaint wrong. They said I could re-submit and open the file back up. I did, and they came back that I was too late. 

Now in XXXX they postponed the event again and again gave a 7 day window for a refund. I carefully submitted my refund request. I photographed the screen after I submitted it. ( D ) After receiving no response from them I actually contacted the ticket vendor for the show, Front Gate Tickets, and explained the entire situation. They sent me an e-mail, ( E ), showing that I had already received a refund. If you look at the form, none of the days or dollar amounts match. ( The final refund they are claiming I received happened before I even bought the original ticket! ) It was clearly not my account and I asked several items to show my name on these "" refunds '' and they simply stopped responding to me. 

I called Chase to again re-open my claim. By this point I had clearly been flagged as a complainer as they were short with me, rude to me, and I was even hung up on twice. I re-submitted my claim, and they denied me again. When I called to ask why, AGAIN, I was told the case was too old. I asked to speak with a Supervisor, was placed on hold for quite some time, then she explained to me that since the original claim was filed incorrectly they would not help me. 

I am beyond frustrated and disappointed in Chase for not only NOT having a customers back but for making me feel like I had done something wrong and I was bothering them! 
I would appreciate any help you can provide. 

I'd also like to note that 3 other girls were to go to this show with my daughter. They all asked for refunds and were ALL denied. Their credit card companies just had their backs!"

i still have not heard back from Chase Bank on resolving my last issue for not closing out my claim in a timely matter and negative reporting to my credit report. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX i called chase bank to inform them that someone has access to my account. The reason for the call is because while logging into my account and seen an unfamiliar number XXXX being the main number where it would receive phone calls and text to access my account. I have never seen this number in my life and there's no record of me calling or updating my information on chase 's website with this information. 

I spoke with 3 different agents on the XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX from fraud dept and XXXX from the dispute dept ). While speaking with XXXX from the fraud department she stated that in her notes someone in her organization has put that number on my account and could not give me a reason why. She insisted that she removed the number. 

After speaking with XXXX i was passed to a XXXX in dispute department because i'm still trying to resolve my dispute with chase and they are still trying to make me pay for an authorized charge that i reported to them. I was told by XXXX i need to reach out to the frauds department by email as they were not available by phone. 

XX/XX/2020 - Speaking with XXXX in the fraud department we discussed the invasion of privacy issue that i'm having with someone in her company changing my contact information without my consent and information i needed to send in about my open fraud claim. i emailed in the necessary documentation that XXXX XXXX d me to email in. Upon receiving my documentation they will let me know in 5 days a decision on my fraud claim and answer on why my contact information is changed and by who XX/XX/2020 - I have now receive a letter from Chase stating they have now lowered my credit limit down to {$5300.00} because they could not reach me at the telephone number provided on my account. XXXX is a disconnected number that was placed on my account by them Chase has now maxed out my credit card limit because they have added interest to my disputed balance of {$5000.00}. This is unethical by chase was done purposely to affect me because of my open dispute. This letter was sent the next day after i contacted them about the problem. They are still investigating my fraud claim which is well over 90 days and have not resolved the issue."

Chase states in attached letters : "" We are not able to send the information you requested. We understand that you had questions about payments that were made on the account in 2017. You requested additional information about the payments and the person making the payments. We are not able to provide that information based on our privacy policy. '' Chase is holding me liable but refuses to supply payment information by the thief on my card that Chase is holding me liable for. Unbelievable! This is totally void of common sense. Does Chase believe the thief will sue them for divulging how the thief sold? 
Then Chase continues in another letter stating "" The claim should be handled as a civil matter directly between you and the known third party to recover the funds. '' SUMMARY - Chase knows how I made payments on my card that they hold me liable yet refuses to give me the fraudulent payment information MADE ON MY CARD reflecting the name of the thief and then informs me this is a civil case between myself and somebody else they refuse to divulge and tells me good luck???? This doesn't make any sense. Chase protects the thief and affords thieves more rights than their own customers. Chase has now acknowledged in their letters that someone else made payments that bounced and refuses to give me the information."

On XX/XX/XXXX, I responded to an offer by Chase to defer payments on my auto loan for 2-3 months. Due to the uncertainty of how the virus would affect my income, I enrolled for the deferral and stopped automatic payments. ( enrollment letter and program expiration letters attached XXXX We were in the process of obtaining a mortgage for a new home during this time. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, My loan officer cautioned me that any mark on my credit report at this time would jeapordize my chances to obtain the mortgage and, as a precaution, advised me to pay up the auto loan with Chase if I could. Since the Covid situation did not affect my business badly, I could make the payments. 

I called Chase on XX/XX/XXXX to tell them that I was going to start making payments to bring the loan current and avoid negative marks on my credit. I clearly stated I did not want to do anything that would jeapordize my credit. The representative told me that my credit would not be affected and I would not be reported late or reported that I was on a deferral. 
I sent them three seperate payments so it would be absolutely clear they should be applied to each monthly payment, instead of being applied as one bulk payment. ( bank statement attached ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase informing me that my "" Covid 19 assistance program has expired '' ( letter attached ). Showing I was in the program from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 

I received a credit alert that I was reported 30 days late for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. 

I contacted Chase Auto Finance and placed a dispute. I was told by the dispute department that since I made the payment in XXXX, the XXXX payment was 30 days late, but the account is now current. Due to the automated process, there was nothing they could do to remove the 30 day late. In addition, they charged me a late fee for the XXXX payment. 

I wrote the 3 major credit bureau 's and entered a dispute. All three came back as having checked with the creditor and finding the results to be accurate as "" Account is current '' In summary, I was on a payment deferral plan, and with all good intention, made payments to insure there would be no issues with my credit. My credit score dropped almost 40 points due to, what I can only guess, was a gross misunderstanding during a very chaotic time. I thought I was doing the right thing. I would have never intentionally jeapordized my credit. 

I respectfully request this 30 day late be removed from my credit reports. 

Thank You."

WE DON'T NEED OR WANT THAT. We have been making our regular payments ON TIME since the first 90 day expired. However, what we have found out is that they have reported us to the credit bureaus as late on both my report and my husbands. According to the email that offered the grace period CHASE wasn't going to report this option as late. Also on our monthly bills, the amount that shows as due is the full 90 days PLUS the current month. We have no problem with making the current payment but there is no way to pay 3 months back payment."

I asked to cancel the XXXX service due to misrepresentation within 3 weeks of signing the contract, but they refused.

I then called Chase bank to discontinue auto draws for the service. The Chase representative told me that he could n't stop the payments, which I did n't understand. He then told me that if I cancelled my card and got a new number that the auto withdraws would not be able to go through. I did as he suggested and cancelled the XXXX card, and got a XXXX one.

The bank rep changed the date as requested, repeated the transaction to me for confirmation and I agreed with him to complete the transaction. On XX/XX/XXXX, I  receive a notice from my bank of an overdraft fee {$35.00} for a payment of {$450.00} for my car payment. I contact Chase Bank to explain the NSF fee due to a payment that was not authorized. Chase Bank explained they needed to review the call with a supervisor to refund the NSF {$35.00} fee. After an hour I was still on the phone waiting for them to process my "" approved '' refund by this supervisor. The bank rep explained I could end the call due to the time it took, call back the next day for confirmation of the refund. The next day I call back and the bank rep explained I need to prove to them that an error had occurred. I couldn't believe my ears. The bank rep said that even though there was an error by Chase, they needed to confirm I was charged a fee from my bank. I asked them why would they not have explained that during the first call, especially since we were on the phone for more than an hour. The bank rep said to process my claim I had to prove they made an error and that my bank charged a fee. I explained to them that by the time I finish this claim, it may have cost me approximately {$100.00} in time and frustration. I asked to speak to a manager during the last call. The manager explained she was sorry for my inconvenience, however, she would have to receive proof that I had a payment process incorrectly and then prove there was a fee assessed as a result. I explained to her my next move would be to write the CFPB if they could not make the necessary corrections and take care of this complaint as a first call resolution. She kindly said thank you and disconnected the call. I did not plan to spend this much time and effort on this complaint. I have to say that I feel like I've experienced both insult and injury on this one. Chase bank makes an unauthorized payment on my account, then tells me that the mistake was made by them. Then Chase bank tells me I have to prove they made a mistake and prove I was assessed fees by my bank after listening to at least 3 different bank reps, and supervisors tell me that the error was with Chase bank. Finally, I was disconnected by a supervisor who could have cared less that I just went through "" XXXX '' and back with Chase on a simple bank error. I know Chase is a very large financial institution, and I should have known not to upset the giant bank. It's the principal of the matter. I'm a customer, infact, I'm a new customer. My next complaint is that the interest rate is too high. I should not have such a high interest rate. Please look in to these matters and take appropriate action. It's still America and the customer should have a more positive experience than this one. Even the small customers."

During this time, I never had a late payment on any of my credit cards or home mortgage loan, not even XXXX time. I maintained excellent credit score, well above XXXX and lately at XXXX. 

Early this year I began receiving notices against each of my accounts from Chase Bank, other than the home mortgage, that Chase has decided to close all of my personal and XXXX Credit Card accounts. I was given a certain date to close my accounts out. Chase said it was within its rights to do so and they did n't have to give me a reason for their action. Including in those accounts were XXXX custodial accounts ; XXXX accounts belong to my daughters attending XXXX XXXX and XXXX of my XXXX-years old mother. I found it outrageous but decided to comply with their requests. 

I rushed to open new bank accounts with another institution and got new credit cards from XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I went to the local branch of Chase Bank and settled all of my credit cards and withdrew my personal funds. 

My Mileage Plus United Chase Visa card, XXXX of XXXX credit cards with Chase, had {$10000.00} balance due per the previous months statement that I paid it off on XXXX XXXX, 2015. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I went to the local bank branch and paid the {$990.00}, the balance incurred since the last statement. Later, I learned that bank assessed additional {$87.00} interest on XXXX XXXX, 2015 that also was paid on XXXX XXXX, 2015, via a phone call. I was entitled to a refund on the annual fee of {$85.00} assessed earlier. 

I had used online access, portal provided by the Chase Bank, to manage my accounts. After the accounts were settled and closed Chase took away my on-line access. In XXXX 2015, I was denied a refinancing loan on my personal residence because Chase had reported {$370.00} due on my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account and reported XXXX late payments ranging between {$25.00} and {$42.00} over the next three month. That was the first time I learned I had derogatory reports on my credit report. 

I called the Bank on XXXX XXXX to confirm these charges. I did not realize that after I had paid up my last balance and brought my XXXX XXXX balance to XXXX on XXXX XXXX, Chase allowed XXXX unauthorized charges that I had no knowledge of on the XXXX Card on XXXX XXXX and XXXX for {$290.00}. Chase also refunded {$85.00} annual fee and had an outstanding balance of {$200.00}. ( XXXX & XXXX bank statements are attached. ) Over the next 6 months that balance became {$370.00} after Chase added late fee and interest and reported XXXX late payments to the Credit Bureaus. Chase never attempted to contact me via a phone call or sent a customary letter or provided monthly bank statements. 

Chase customer service representative, who identified herself as XXXX, told me that it was not Bank 's responsibility to inform me about my statements because I was using an on-line access. The fact that the on-line access was taken away after I was forced to close my accounts was none of their concern. However, the Bank felt obliged to continue to assess interest and penalties and also reported to the Credit Bureaus but saw no reason to inform me. I requested the bank statements. 

After the bank statements were received I called bank on XXXX XXXX, 2015, to resolve my credit report issues. XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX location told me that I had no recourse and all he could do was to accept my payment of {$370.00} ( includes {$170.00} in penalties and interest ) on the phone that could be charged to my new XXXX XXXX account. I authorized the payment. Chase maintained my personal information ( phone, address, new bank ) but chose not to contact me. 

In conclusion, Chase removed my account access, never sent me an account statement, and I had no way of knowing the charges or penalties."

To the customers knowledge, FIVE MONTHS LATER : the seller has NEVER presented nor has the seller provided any evidence that a SEWING MACHINE CABINET was EVER shipped nor has a SEWING MACHINE CABINET ever been received by the customer NONE whatsoever! Not a shred NOTHING whatsoever! No shipping documents, no delivery documents, no receiving documents,,,,, NOTHING! 

Six weeks later not having received the order the customer notified the seller by email to please cancel the order. And as such the customer also requested Chase Visa to dispute the charge. As of today, five months later the cabinet has still not been received by the customer. 

For Chase the ethical business practice would have been to ; refund the amount charged to the Visa account to the customer and advise the seller to deal directly with customer INSTEAD Chase made a conscience business decision to take the most XXXX XXXX unethical business solution approach JP Morgan Chase Visa they could ponder up. JP Morgan Chase Visa made a conscience business decision defraud the customer : Chase made a conscience effort to bully and terrorize the customer : charging her several hundred dollars late charges and interest, terrorizing with threatening letters, turning customer in numerous times to credit bureaus for late payment, calling the customer all hours of the day and night several times a day, on numerous occasions out right lying to XXXX XXXX XXXX, again in essence using the XXXX XXXX  most unethical business practices they could ponder up Chase Visa is the XXXX XXXX. 
The customer has over the last several months accumulated several hundred documents of back and forth communications with Chase always yes ALWAYS I said ALWAYS within 24 hours, XXXX Chase is taking the hear no see no say no approach anything to defraud and steal what they can from the customer in effort to cover up their incompetent initially mis handlings! 

As of today, the order still NOT received! 

AS FOLLOWS IS THE CUSTOMERS FINAL RESPONSE ( response 2 of 2 ) TO THE XXXX   Customer final response to the XXXX  : Dear XXXX  XXXX Chase lied again to the XXXX, shame on XXXX Chase! 

Chase has continued to lie about the sequence of events, one outright lies after another outright lie about the sequences of events, one outright lies after lie after lie!!!

I certainly did respond immediately virtually within minutes of receiving any/all Chase communication both email and mail ALWAYS without fail! To claim I didnt is another outright Chase LIE always a continuous stream of lies! 

ANYTIME Chase wants to polygraph I would welcome them versus me in fact I WOULD PAY FOR BOTH! Come out you XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX lets make it happen! XXXX XXXX XXXX   COME OUT YOU COWARDS!!! 

Chase you lied to XXXX claiming you mailed your response letter to the customer on Monday XX/XX/2020 when in fact WAITING until Friday XX/XX/XXXX to mail the customer response. YES, another example of Chase Visa XXXX  unethical business practices! 

Why would Chase do that? Like I said another Chase XXXX XXXX unethical business practice : knowing that the XXXX  closes all claims to XXXX  at five days if no counter response is made by claimant. By holding the customer response two days and knowing it would take an additional 3-5 business mail to reach the customer ( that would be 8 days ) they could deceive the XXXX  into closing the claim, another example of Chase Visa XXXX  unethical business practice! 

Chase Visa this is NOT going away! 

Lied to the XXXX  a flat-out bald face lies to the XXXX  did not mail on the XXXX held 3 days before mailing! XXXX XXXX unethical business practice of Chase! Lied to the XXXX! AGAIN! 

Shame on XXXX Chase Visa. I actually believe and after reading this you will also believe Chase Visa draws straws to see which can fabricate the biggest outright lie. WOW, lying to the XXXX   SHAME on Chase! Shame on XXXX Chase!!! 
And yes, I did save the envelope with the postage date, for future reference. 
Chase had every opportunity to get this right reversing the charge LONG before the seller CLAIMED to have shipped the product. 

However, with malice of forethought Chase made the conscious CHOICE to shove it up the customers XXXX RATHER than taking the CONTRACTUAL, honest, and ethical action XXXX XXXX   unethical business practices! 

Why because it was easier to STEAL from the customer than to get the money back from the seller ( did I mention you could XXXX XXXX ) the simple solution months ago! In other words, Chase botched the dispute then attempt after attempt to cover up with a continuous stream of lies! 

Is Chase Visa criminally liable for constructive acts to defraud? Did Chase violate the the Consumers Protection Act? I IMPLORE Federal and State Attorney Generals of all 50 states to go after Chase Visa for XXXX XXXX unethical immoral breach of customer contract practices! 

This should be more than a GREAT example of a massive class action, after what I have experienced, I have to believe this has happened to hundreds if not thousands of other Chase Visa victims. 

I DEMAND full RESTITUTION, a FORMAL letter of apology and a complete cleansing of my credit history not to mention charter assignation, slander, liable damages! all because of the XXXX XXXX   unethical immoral business practices of Chase VISA!

As of today, I have still NOT received the SEWING MACHINE CABINET for which Chase STOLE {$190.00} PLUS {$400.00} from me! 

Had they done their job in the first place ( what they are contracted to do ) this scenario would never have occurred. Instead they lie after lie after lie bullying, threatening, and terrorizing customers! 

My credit rating once in the mid 800s never even remotely close to late payment for the most part always paying the entire balance PRIOR to receiving the statement all prior to CHASE terrorize and bully tactics! 

Bullying slandering character assassination collection calls late charges multiple lies to credit bureaus multiple lies to the XXXX,,,,, for {$190.00} sewing cabinet NEVER received!

The information coming in all at one has been overwhelming and both XXXX and JPMorgan Chase have sent responses without CFPB assigned case numbers and these additional mail have responses that have been changed and reworded and documents enclose are also have a slight variation. I need more time to properly respond. Meanwhile, you must continue to Cease and Desist all trustee sale activities until I am given proper time to respond. Both XXXX, and JPMorgan Chase have requested additional time and I should be allowed the same consideration. You must Cease and Desist especially for the following reasons with regards the Corporate Assignment of Deed of Trust, Instrument # XXXX ( AODOT ) and the Substitution of Trustee, Instrument # XXXX ( SOT ). Both Instruments are invalid due to evidence that the documents were executed fraudulently. 1. The Corporate Assignment of Deed of Trust, Instrument # XXXX ( AODOT ) must be VOID for the following reasons : a. XXXX XXXX XXXX does not have any authority to sign as a XXXX   XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX. ( XXXX ) Employee. b. XXXX XXXX XXXX was also a JP Morgan Chase Bank ( JPMC ) employee on XXXX. She was working in the Chain of Title Department fulfilling a variety of tasks. c. XXXX XXXX XXXX has been known to sign for JPMC as Vice-President. d. The acknowledgement is does not conform to California and Louisiana Laws/Statutes. e. XXXX XXXX, the Notary is authorized so perform Notarial acts within her Parish, and how can she acknowledge XXXX XXXX XXXX signature if she is a XXXX employee and XXXX is located in XXXX, Michigan? f. Once again, there is no supporting document attached to the AODOT, showing that XXXX XXXX has authority to sign for XXXX. g. On my Cease and Desist letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, I asked for even a CORPORATE RESOLUTION as required under the XXXX consent order in XX/XX/XXXX and yet, I still have not received this document from either XXXX and, or JPMorgan Chase. h. There is no mention of the ADJUSTABLE RATE NOTE ( NOTE ). The DEED OF TRUST, Instrument # XXXX ( DOT ) must follow the NOTE. i. This was not acknowledged Under Penalty of Perjury and it also does not conform to the Corporate Acknowledgement laws/statues of Louisiana. It also does not conform to Californias Corporate Acknowledgement within that state either. California Civil Code 1189 and 1190. j. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) is a DEFUNCT company. XXXX filed a certificate of surrender on XX/XX/XXXX. k. XXXX ( XXXX, without an XXXX ) was suspended to conduct business in California on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX ( XXXX, with an XXXX  ) registered with the California Secretary of State in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX can not be a nominee under DOT for several reasons but especially because XXXX was not licensed to conduct business in California. l. XXXX XXXX, was a Senior Vice President at XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), located in Florida ( now is a CIO ) prepared the AODOT. XXXX is a mortgage m. document preparation and recording company. XXXX XXXX, while employed at XXXX, PREPARED THE AODOT and sent the blank document to JPMC. XXXX XXXX XXXX, a Senior Operations Specialist who was employed at JPMC n. from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX signed the blank document prepared by XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. JPMC/XXXX XXXX XXXX, sent the executed AODOT, without an attached XXXX  Corporate Resolution attached as required, especially by the XXXX Consent Order in XX/XX/XXXX back to XXXX. XXXX then, requested for the AODOT to be recorded at the XXXX XXXX County Recorders Office on XX/XX/XXXX. o. This AODOT is clearly robo-signed and fraudulent. p. The chain of title is BROKEN. See the MISSING ASSIGNMENTS ( securitization ) below. i. Assignment from XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Sponsor for the purported Trust, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) is missing. ii. Assignment from XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX. ( XXXX XXXX ) ( Depositor of XXXX XXXX ) q. CA Civil Code 1190, Proof of Acknowledgement of Instruments. The certificate of acknowledgment of an instrument executed on behalf of an incorporated or unincorporated entity by a duly authorized person in the orm specified in Section 1189 shall be prima facie evidence that the instrument is the duly authorized act of the entity named in the instrument and shall be conclusive evidence thereof in favor of any good faith purchaser, lessee, or encumbrancer. Duly authorized person, with respect to a domestic or foreign corporation, includes the president, vice president, secretary, and assistant secretary of the corporation. r. The AODOT in XXXX XXXX opinion is a WILD DEED. A wild deed is a recorded deed that is not in the chain of title because a previous instrument connected to the chain of title was not recorded. This wild deed, Instrument # XXXX will not, can not provide constructive notice to later purchasers of the property, because subsequent bona fide purchasers ( BFP ) can not reasonably be expected to locate the deed while investigating the chain of title to the property. A wild deed is also known as a thin air deed. The Problem of the Wild Deed : If a deed, entered on the records ( A to B ), has a grantor unconnected to the chain of title ( O to A ), then deed is a wild deed. It is incapable of giving record notice of its existence. s. The NOTE and DOT was never assigned to the trust when the Trust, XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. t. UNPERFECTED LIEN. In XX/XX/XXXX there was blanket lien perfection under California Commercial Code 9312 the Assignment of Deed of Trust must be filed within 20 days of XX/XX/XXXX sale to, in this case based on the AODOT, XXXX would have to be the new investor. u. Fraudulent indorsement on the Adjustable Rate Note. v. Unclean Hands. w. False Claims x. The AODOT was recorded on XX/XX/XXXX while XXXX XXXX was still in ACTIVE Chapter XXXX, Bankruptcy. This only proves that the purported loan # XXXX by XXXX had an UNSECURED STATUS when he filed for Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy protection on XX/XX/XXXX. This is a violation of the Automatic Stay. The Creditors were asked to file their PROOF OF CLAIM, and not attempt to perfect a lien and fraudulently claim ownership without satisfactory evidence as XX/XX/XXXXor XX/XX/XXXX. y. There are other issues XXXX XXXX finds to be irregular and questionable with regards to the AODOT and we will address them at another time. 2. The Substitution of Trustee, Instrument # XXXX ( SOT ) should be VOID for many reasons : a. XXXX of all, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) can not be the Trustee of the purported Trust, XXXX XXXX for reasons mentioned in Section 1 above. b. The SOT is invalid because it was executed by a XXXX XXXX, a XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. ( XXXX ) Document Control Officer on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX claims to be the Attorney-in-Fact to the purported current Beneficiary, XXXX, as the Trustee of the Trust XXXX XXXX. Per Section 24 of the DOT, only the lender is names as the party authorized to appoint a successor trustee. The Deed of Trust does notallow for the beneficiary to execute the Substitution of Trustee. c. The SOT Notary Acknowledgement does not conform to California and Utah Laws/Statutes. d. CA Civil Code 1190,  Proof of Acknowledgement of Instruments. The certificate of acknowledgment of an instrument executed on behalf of an incorporated or unincorporated entity by a duly authorized person in the form specified in Section 1189 shall be prima facie evidence that the instrument is the duly authorized act of the entity named in the instrument and shall be conclusive evidence thereof in favor of any good faith purchaser, lessee, or encumbrancer. Duly authorized person, with respect to a domestic or foreign corporation, includes the president, vice president, secretary, and assistant secretary of the corporation. e. There is not a Sub-By-Code Declaration of record as required by CA Civil Code 2934a ( 2 ) ( D ). The statute states the following : Notice of the substitution was sent by certified mail, postage prepaid, with return receipt requested to each holder of an interest in the obligation secured by the deed of trust who has not joined in the execution of the substitution or the separate document. The separate document shall be attached to the substitution and be recorded in the office of the county recorder of each county in which the real property described in the deed of trust is located. Once the document required by this paragraph is recorded, it shall constitute conclusive evidence of compliance with the requirements of this paragraph in favor of substituted trustees acting pursuant to this section, subsequent assignees of the obligation secured by the deed of trust and subsequent bona fide purchasers or encumbrancers for value of the real property described therein. f. The Grantor Trustor, XXXX XXXX is not listed on the Index which doesnt allow contructive notice. When you search for recorded documents, the SOT does not appear. This has been addressed numerous time and including to XXXX XXXX  XXXX, Vice-President of XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and her reply to me was, its not our fault that the County Recorder erroneously did not index the Substitution of Trustee properly. Later that day when I sent her an email recapping the days events and correspondence and telephone conversations. Since XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX and I keep good, clean and concise records of all correspondence and conversations. g. XXXX XXXX, the Notary is authorized so perform Notarial acts within her Parish, and how can she acknowledge XXXX XXXX XXXX signature if she is a XXXX employee and XXXX is located in XXXX, Michigan? h. Once again, there is no supporting document attached to the AODOT, showing that XXXX XXXX has authority to sign for XXXX. All parties mentioned above have, still continues to fraudulently act in concert to confuse, mislead and falsely claiming ownership of XXXX XXXX property and threatening to foreclose when they have not proven standing. Under the terms of the NMS and HBOR, you must adhere to significant new homeowner protection. The consent order requires that JP Morgan Chase and its affiliates meets the servicing standards set up by the XX/XX/XXXX National Mortgage Settlement ( NMS ) with the five largest banks. Specifically, XXXX is in violation of California Civil Code section 2923.55 in that SPS and JPMorgan Chase continues to fail in provide ALL the requested documents as required by code even though this demand has been made in writing to XXXX on since XX/XX/XXXX and JPMC since XX/XX/XXXX and again on XX/XX/XXXX by phone, Qualified Written Request and Cease and Desist letters in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. JP Morgan Chase, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX and its subsidiaries, are also in VIOLATION of the HBOR and many other CALIFORNA, FEDERAL LAWS and ACTS. Specifically, JP Morgan XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are continues to violate California Civil Code Section 2924.17 in that the recorded documents are not accurate and are not supported by competent and reliable evidence. There seems to be strong evidence of robo-signing, perjury and forgery in the documents recorded in the official land records of XXXX XXXX County. I am especially referring to the act of XXXX falsely claiming to be the owner ( XXXX/XXXX ) of XXXX XXXX property by fraudulently recording an AODOT XXXX XXXX County Recorders Office on XX/XX/XXXX ( see above ). XXXX XXXX XXXX is also being formally notified the "" substitution of trustee '' is now VOID on its face, and as such has NO LEGAL EFFECT. XXXX XXXX XXXX and is acting without right or authority and all publications by XXXX XXXX  are without privilege, subjecting XXXX XXXX XXXX to slander of title liability. XXXX XXXX XXXX is claiming to be a properly substituted trustee, and as such, is to act as an independent third-party who is responsible to all parties, not just XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX is being formally notified that all trustee sale activities are in violation of in VIOLATION of JP Morgan Chase and its Subsidiaries NMS, Californias HBOR and all other State and Federal laws. XXXX XXXX continues to dispute the VALIDITY of the AODOT and SOT filed at the XXXX XXXX County Recorders Office. This letter is a formal COMPLAINT addressing XXXX XXXX concerns and DISPUTING THE VALIDITY OF ALL DOCUMENTS recorded and filed in the XXXX XXXX County Recorders Office where the documents listed below have been filed against his once, good title. In addition to the AODOT, SOT, this complaint is also addressing two Notices of Default, Notice of Rescission of the Notice of Default and Two Notices of Trustee Sale. The title to his property located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX has been slandered and clouded by numerous false, robo-signed and potentially even fraudulent documents. See the see attached EXHIBITS with my notes of fraud, irregularities and etc. This letter is a formal CEASE AND DESIST from any further trustee sale activities against XXXX XXXX and his property. Specifically, the "" assignment '' to the alleged beneficiary, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the purported Trustee of the securitized trust, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was done by XXXX  without authority of the principal and fails to acknowledge the principal. The assignment is void on its face and is of no legal effect. The XXXX is fraudulent, see attached EXHIBIT. A XXXX employee, XXXX XXXX had no authority to execute and caused to be filed and record at the land records of XXXX XXXX County, a Corporate Assignment of Deed of Trust in the name of XXXX  and especially while holding title as a Senior Operations Specialist for JPMorgan Chase. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. has no standing. The Assignment is fraudulent, flawed, void and has no effect. There was also no mention of the NOTE in the Corporate Assignment of Deed of Trust and it also was not acknowledged under Penalty of Perjury. The  Corporate Assignment of Deed of Trust did not list the CORRECT trust name. The TRUST name is  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the DEPOSITOR of the trust is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and not XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The title to my property been slandered many times by all these fraudulent documents being recorded my property since. The SOT has numerous violations, irregularities and obvious robo-signing. The individual who prepared or requested of did not Index the Trustor or nor was there an Affidavit of Mailing attached other irregularities. The Notice of Default is now in void on its face, and as such has no legal effect. XXXX XXXX XXXX is acting without right or authority and all publications by XXXX XXXX XXXX are without privilege, subjecting XXXX XXXX XXXX to Slander of Title liability. XXXX XXXX XXXX is also being formally notified of the Substitution of Trustee is null and void on its face, and as such has no legal effect. XXXX XXXX XXXX is acting without authority and all publication by XXXX XXXX XXXX are without privilege subjecting XXXX XXXX XXXX to Slander of Title liability. XXXX XXXX XXXX is claiming to be the properly substituted Trustee though I am disputing the of this substitution and as such, is to act as an independent 3rd party who is responsible to ALL parties, not just XXXX XXXX XXXX is being formally notified the intended Trustee Sale is in violation of several California Civil, USC and UCC Codes. Per Civil Code 2924.12, I may seek damages of {$50000.00} for material violations as well as attorneys fees. Please contact me via email at XXXX and also copy XXXX XXXX at XXXX to discuss further.

Instead Chase told OCC they deleted the call and did not send that letter, but instead sent a letter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX stating that the XXXX account was still reflecting on my credit file and they were requesting it to be deleted.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I believe, I logged onto my Chase bank app and scheduled my car payment to come out on XX/XX/XXXX, instead of the traditional XXXX of every month. With the XXXX being XXXX, I figured it was the responsible thing to do. Yesterday morning on the XXXX of XXXX, my payment for my car loan came out of my XXXX XXXX  checking account, {$390.00} as scheduled. This morning which is now XX/XX/XXXX, ANOTHER CHARGE for {$390.00} came out of my account, making it a double charge for my car payment. 

I caught onto this double charge and immediately started making phone calls! My first call was to Chase, in XXXX, CO off of XXXX XXXX, and they were very non-helpful and just directed me back to calling XXXX XXXX  ( where my accounts are located ) and left it at that! 

So after calling XXXX XXXX, those folks told me the right thing to do would be to call Chase back and speak to a manager about the situation. Although the XXXX XXXX  employee was very helpful and even said he could start the dispute but I wouldnt get my reimbursement funds in a reasonable timeframe he still thought that I would be better off taking up situation with Chase because technically it was their mistake in the first place. And even if it was a user error on the app, I should still be able to have access to my rightful funds when a transaction is disputed, right? 

So as of now, I talked to Chase once again in the Auto Loan department, and they have squared away the refund, BUT I wont have the funds available until XX/XX/XXXX? This is what angers me!!! I am currently on vacation ( we left this morning ) and now I am out basically {$400.00} that I can not use. The gentleman from their customer service department said that with the upcoming holiday XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) I wouldnt be able to access the refund funds until the XXXX of XXXX? 

WHY WHEN THEY ARE ACTIVELY STILL WORKING THE NEXT 2 days!!!! Why do I have to wait until the XXXX if they have employees working until the holiday?? I just want this squared away, and I would like my funds in the next day or so, so I can enjoy my vacation!!!!"

On XXXX XXXX.2020 I have used my card for amazon on XX/XX/2020 made a purchase on this day. This was the last time I had the card with me and last time i used this card for that purchase, I filed a police report and I told him I was not sure whether I drop my wallet on the walking ramp to go XXXX or if I dropp it inside the train I believe it was inside because I remember I took the one time ticket fair pass and used it to go in. It had to be inside the train. 
There was people near me following rules and keeping distance do to the Coronavirus situation there was like 6 of us sitting on one side of the train keeping distance I was running late I had my lunch bag and another bag with tools for work as I was arriving to my location I got up and walk it out. The wallet had to slide off my pockets and stood in the chair not sure what had happen.

I had about XXXX cash and my chase card and a school ID that my student ID number which is XXXX my pin was XXXX some how they saw it and tried it first and used the card. 
I called the bank and gave them a police report and told them about the frauds and they help me out by disputing them all thru the phone.as it takes longer to speak to a banker from what is happening now due to the virus. 
The lady representative was very polite very nice and took take of me. I gave her as much information as possible and the police report number. 
Chase took care of me and Im very happy to know that they would protect my account as they did. 
My concern now is that I just received a letter as of XX/XX/2020 Telling me that as of their investigation they believe that no fraud was made or that I had authorized anyone to use my card. 
I didnt not allowed any one to have my information or debit card I lost it and it was stolen and used places and atms Im not responsible for this unauthorized transaction ive used most of the funds to pay a work labor At home. 

My funds and chase believe that no error was made. 
This is incorrect and I havent received any paper work from chase as the lady representative said she would mail me paper work if it was need it some one would contact me but they didnt and Im still waiting on any dispute documents I havent received any yet theres been a problem with the mail from the post office be sending my letter to different adress as my home adress is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX he gets confused and wants them to XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX.

We billed them XXXX tuition as well and within a week of that happening XXXX XXXX contacted us saying that they never signed their children up to take classes and wanted to quit. We informed him that we need 30 days written notice to stop billing and that there was a {$150.00} per child early termination fee as stated in the contract his wife signed. We compromised with him despite his rude emails and attempt to physically bully and intimidate my husband into giving him money. We refunded the XXXX tuition payments and agreed to refund half of the {$300.00} early termination fee. He agreed to these terms and we processed the refunds. XXXX then contacted his credit card company, Chase Banks, and tried to report the XXXX tuition payments as fraud and claim that the refunds were never processed and that he never agreed to the early termination fee. We submitted all documentation including the contract, the attendance records, and the emails between us and XXXX. The initial findings of the company were in our favor and the money was re-deposited into our account. XXXX XXXX is trying to dispute the early termination fee again and despite all the documentation showing otherwise, Chase Banks has decided to just take the money out of our account and give it back to XXXX XXXX. Because of the mess this family and Chase Banks has caused, we were able to pay our employees but had forego paying myself and my husband our payroll. These tactics create a financial nightmare for businesses and cost us a lot of time and money when we have to contact our accountants and lawyers. After all that XXXX XXXX is again trying to dispute the early termination fee and even though Chase was given all the documentation showing justification for the fee and XXXX XXXX agreeing to the fee, they have taken the money out of our account again and said our documentation does n't count and only the word of their client does. When I contacted Chase to discuss this with them and offered to re-send the documentation they were extremely rude to me from the employee I started speaking with all the way up to the supervisor who was even more rude and condescending to me. In a nutshell, Chase has taken the position that they will do whatever their client wants and businesses are bad people no matter what documentation is presented to them indicating otherwise. I do not appreciate being treated this way and can not run a business when people do not pay for our services they have used and then use their credit card company to bully us and steal money from us. It is not OK to just willy-nilly take money from other people 's accounts without a valid reason, especially when they have proven their case previously."

We were able to go INTO the branch and file a fraud complaint resulting in getting our funds put back into our account. 

I had most of our money in our new savings account which is an account we do not typically have activity in because it just sits holding money. I more closely monitor our checking account because that one has activity in it. I did not notice the {$2.00} ACH from our savings XX/XX/XXXX then in XXXX XXXX {$2.00} and {$2.00} XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX {$3.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$3.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$1.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$9.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$3.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$9.00} At first I glanced at these smaller amounts because so minute I thought dividends it did not register. Then on XX/XX/XXXX as the country was facing a pandemic and things were shutting down larger amounts started coming out. I was like most people dealing with job loss, children having to learn how to work from home to keep up with schooling. My husband was trying to retain the clients he had by offering free services so that they might return when businesses opened up again. Not normal circumstances for anyone. 

As we sat struggling through quarantine, the hackers successfully removed {$7400.00} from my savings in 10 transactions between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I was notified that I reached the withdraw limit that's when I noticed the activity and filed with chase fraud that moment. Because they were so helpful the first time this happened I had no doubt that they would seen this fraudulent activity and we would see out money again. 

I understand that this is spread over a period of time. What they need to understand is the situation itself. This is an account that we let sit so do not check on it as often as we should. The actual time frame with the most money stolen was during a worldwide pandemic which everyones focus was all over. The vendor name on the ACH transfers was one we are familiar seeing because we use XXXX XXXX   however this is not actually XXXX. Even that did not put up a red flag at first glance. 

There is information I found when looking at regulation E which was written back in the XXXX XXXX when we really didn't use online banking like we do now. Perhaps that should be updated. Apparently there is only a 60 day window from the first transaction which there was only one XX/XX/XXXX for {$2.00} then nothing until XX/XX/XXXX so nothing else is even considered even though it is straight up theft any way you look at it. I do take responsibility for being in a terrible situation along with the entire world, country, and state and I do wish I would have caught this in XXXX. If it was in the checking which we use daily it would have been caught ASAP, first attempt. 

Thank You XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX"

They are connected to our joint personal checking account. The new cards, however, had different XXXX numbers from the original cards they were meant to replace. 

We found this change extremely inconvenient since it would require us to change all of our automatic payment settings ( XXXX, XXXX XXXX, many online merchants such XXXX, XXXX, etc. ). We asked for new cards with the same account number. The Chase representative said that was indeed possible. 

Chase sent us new cards bearing the chip, a new expiration date and CVV code, but with the old original XXXX account number, just as we requested. 

Yesterday, as I attempted to check out at a local XXXX, my debit card would not work. I immediately called Chase, but got an hour and a half 's worth of the runaround ( the "" system '' says the card has been cancelled, etc, etc., ad nauseam ). 

Chase was able to reactivate the card for long enough for me to complete my XXXX purchase, after which I went directly to my Chase Bank branch. 

My personal banker saw on his computer display that my debit card did, indeed, have a cancellation alert in bright red letters. Neither he nor I could understand why my wife 's debit card has no such alert, even though it went through the exact same replacement and re-replacement process. 

I believe that whoever arranged to have the same-account-number cards sent to us caused my wife 's new card to remain valid until its XXXX expiration date, but neglected to permit my card to be used beyond yesterday. Yesterday, it turns out, was the date the non-chip-bearing card would expire had I ignored Chase 's XXXX 2015 letter. I did not ignore it. 

Apparently the "" system '' still thinks I am using the no-chip card when, in fact, I am carrying a now unusable chip-bearing card. 

Without borrowing my wife 's valid card, I am unable to withdraw cash at an ATM nor make any purchases. 

Chase refuses to override its "" system '' and no XXXX there is able to think outside the box. 

This is absolutely the worst customer "" service '' I have ever experienced anywhere. 

Can you help straighten Chase out?"

This is now my THIRD escalation to the CFPB regarding this matter. Chase Auto continues to provide responses that are inaccurate and untrue. Additionally, they are not responding in full to my concerns or providing any resolution. The two responses provide feedback that contradicts what the other one says. I want to break this down in hopes that I get a true and honest response from Chase. It is concerning that these responses are coming from on executive level office and have this many inaccuracies. 
In my response from Chase, I request that they number their responses to correspond with my numbered concerns in order to ensure that they have addressed each matter in full so that I can stop running on this hamster wheel they have put me on. 
1-In the letter from Chase dated XX/XX/XXXX they state that my XXXX account is neither a demand deposit or checking account. So, they are unable to pull the payment from that account. In my escalation back on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I provided my XXXX statements that PROVE that Chase has historically pulled my payments from this account. My XXXX account is both a demand deposit and a checking account. My payroll is direct deposited in this account. Additionally, all my bills are pulled by other companies ( much smaller than Chase ) directly from this account. There have been no issues. Then in Chase response dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX they stated that the do not accept direct check payments from online banks. Again, I am submitting the proof that they DO.  There is no reason for this. My account is a BANK account ; it has an account number and a routing number. By failing to accept direct payment from my BANK account you are causing me financial harm. Please advise why Chase ( who has pulled payments from this account historically as shown in enclosed bank statements ) is now claiming they dont? Now when I called Chase bank they conveniently offered to sign me up for a bank account with Chasenow isnt that just a coincidence?? NopeI think you are refusing my payment to try to earn money both on my interest and by forcing consumers to open bank accounts they dont want. That is a no no! Please advise in your response to me, why you have historically pulled payments from my XXXX account as proven and why you are stating you dont? Why is there a contradiction here? Additionally, please advise why Chase refuses as I have bills from XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and all my major utilities pulled from my bank account with no issues. And you have had no issues in the past either. This seems to be an excuse to cover your refusal to take my payment in order to charge me more fees. 
2-Chase states in the letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX that XXXX XXXX XXXX is affiliated with XXXX XXXX  XXXX. FALSE!!! It is a CREDIT UNION!!!!! A credit union by definition is NOT A BANK!!! Nor is it affiliated with a bank. If you were using a routing number that got you to XXXX XXXX than you were using the wrong routing number, NOT the one I provided you and confirmed at minimum 5 times over the phone with your representatives. You are obviously doing something incorrectly and refusing to be accountable for it. 
3-Chase states in the letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to contact them once I make my payments. HOW DO I MAKE A PAYMENT? They refuse to draft from my XXXX XXXX account anymore, they claim my Credit Union account is a XXXX XXXX XXXX account ( it is not ), and the last time I had to XXXX XXXX a payment, which is wrong, I shouldnt have to pay more to try to make a payment that Chase cant seem to handle pulling even though historically they always have. Please advise. 
4-There will be NO negative credit reporting on this otherwise there will be a lawsuit. I am TRYING to make payments and Chase making excuses and telling lies to drag this out and make more money is maddening. But I am not paying fees for XXXX XXXX and/or money orders for this as I have two bank accounts that are more than acceptable and historically Chase has pulled from. 
5-Chase did not provide a response to my reimbursement for the XXXX XXXX payment I had to make. I want reimbursed for this."

I am signed up for paperless billing, and Chase did send me an email, which I later realized. However, as an XXXX XXXX XXXX during XXXX, I was working extra shifts at my XXXX, and due to the high stress nature of this pandemic, I was not checking personal email as frequently. This led to my account becoming 30 days past due and deliquent for an unpaid balance of {$7.00} in XXXX and was reported as such in XXXX as well. My credit score went from a XXXX to a XXXX. When I spoke to Chase in XXXX they reversed the charges as "" interest charge reversal '' claiming they agreed it was unreasonable and told me to file a dispute with the credit bureaus. I did this. Because Chase is claiming there was no banking error they will not change the delinquency reporting. Because Chase will not change the delinquency reporting, the credit agencies will not change the delinquency on my account either even though now it says I owed {$0.00}. However, if chase reversed the charges of interest accrued to my account after the account was paid in full, then {$7.00} was never late because it was never owed. I have never been late or deliquent on any account with any company and my credit score has always reflected this."

The proceeds for the closing XXXX was credited to our account at Chase Bank via wire transfer onXX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/, we'd reserved a XXXX truck to move our belongings to XXXX XXXX. We when arrived at the rental agency to rent the truck using our Chase debit card we were told that the transaction was declined. I called the customer service number listed on the back of the card XXXX. I was told by the representative from the "" fraud department '' that they need to verify my identity in order to release the "" block '' on my card. The asked for a password that I did not remember. The asked for some secondary security questions which I answered and told me they would reset the password. After resetting the password I was transferred to another representative that again advised me they needed to verify my identity and needed my password. After giving them the password that I had given the the previous representative, I was told that it was not correct and I would have to go into a branch and give them my identification before they could removed the block. We rushed to the closest branch and gave the representative my identification. The branch representative called the fraud department and confirmed my identification and had the block removed. The representative advised us that everything was OK and we should not have another issue. I asked if we'd be able to wire transfer money via online banking and was told they we would be able to. We went back to the XXXXXXXX and rented the truck for the move. 

We are purchasing our home in XXXX XXXX and were scheduled to close today XX/XX/. I went to make the wire transfer online on Tuesday XX/XX/ and was notified that the wire transfer limit was {$25000.00}. Our cash to close amount is {$100000.00}. I called the customer service office and asked if I could give authorization to make the wire transfer to the closing agent in the appropriate amount. I was told by several different representatives that I would have to "" go into the branch '' in order to make the wire transfer. I explained to the representative what was happening, that I had closed on my house in XXXX  and was buying a house in XXXX XXXX  ( looking at the history ) in my account clearly shows that. We let them know that there were no branches in the state of XXXX XXXX. They advised me that they had a branch in West Virginia that was the closest to me. I told the representative that they was not possible for me to drive/fly to West Virginia in order to send a wire back to XXXX XXXX. They representative continually repeated that the only way I could get the transaction done was to go into a branch. I called a branch office in XXXX XXXX, Florida where we used to live to see if the branch would take a notarized authorization from me to make the transfer. They indicated we would have to physically come to the branch in order to send a wire transfer. Their only suggestion was that I drive to the branch in West Virginia. 

Frustrated, I have had to contact the closing attorney 's office and advise that we can not close because the bank that I have been with for over 30 years will not allow me to initiate a wire transfer without physically being in an office. I will have to write a check to the closing attorney and have them deposit it to their escrow account and wait 7-10 days for the check to clear before we can close. 

This is totally unacceptable behavior on the part of Chase Bank."

Then in XX/XX/2019, fraud # 1 occurred on my joint account which I have with my fianc. That was moderately easy to resolve for a {$2000.00} fraud and was what we had hoped and expected of such a prominent bank. Then, fraud # 2 in XXXX, for a higher amount than the original, and conducted in the same fashion ( someone pretended to be me over the phone, ordered a card, changed the account phone number, intercepted the card delivery & used the card at a branch far away from where I live, work or ever go to ). This time Chase claimed the fraud  was not in fact fraud & tried to lay blame on my fianc and I. We are both hardworking, honest XXXX  in the XXXX XXXX, with XXXX XXXX XXXX and have been loyal Chase consumers on both personal banking and credit side for years. We have zero motive to commit any fraud, yet Chase has concluded that this was not fraud. They refused to look deeply into concluding that it is a fraud ( they didn't monitor the call that was made, look at XXXX from the branch in which the fraud occurred, compare signatures of whoever received the expedited card to mine or my fiance 's, or analyzed our banking history ) ... we were out {$2800.00} of our hard earned money which Chase and they had refused to refund due to their poor conclusion. We had, at the time, a mortgage to pay and a XXXX  on the way, yet they do a half- ***** investigation and felt they have the right to hold our money hostage. After some XXXX and FTC complaints, their Customer Care team who handles those, was able to do a more thorough investigation and refund our funds sometime at the end of XXXX. During that time, my online access and all accounts had been locked, both debit and credit, had been locked [ my online access is still locked until I find time to make it to a branch, which has been difficult with a XXXX  ]. I made some successful and some not successful attempts to make my Chase credit card payments during this time period [ recordings and call records should show this ]. The non-successful attempts were due to my account being locked and during these calls I would get tossed around from department to department, and sometimes due to the constraints of my lunch-break, would have to hang up. Long story short, I was able to make payments to my Chase Freedom card, but was unable to do so for the Chase Sapphire due to the lock and unsuccessful call transfers from Chase representatives. I was led to believe that until my fraud issues were resolved that I would not need to make payments due to everything being locked, but I still made this attempt and was successful with the Chase Freedom. I did not receive paper statements to my address, nor emails, and it wasn't until I was already over 30 days late apparently, that Chase decided to call me and finally process a payment. They made no attempt via phone call before this. This, furthermore, led to Chase reporting a 30-day delinquency to the credit bureaus for my Chase Sapphire card AND this sparked their Credit Services Risk Analysis team to lower my credit limits by more than {$10000.00}, affecting my credit score even more. This has been devastating to my score, especially in the midst of my fianc and I attempting to buy a house together before he XXXX. I was now unable to get pre-approved with him, due to the delinquency and reduced credit limits which dropped my score from XXXX to XXXX. All of this has been caused by CHASE. We made attempts to at least get a "" Good faith adjustment '' to have the 30-day delinquency removed [ which is a huge factor in the credit score drop ], since I have been a good customer to Chase and never had anything negative. They were unable to do their due diligence to us and at least investigate the fraud portion [ which had already caused us a big financial burden both times ] or even check the call recordings or attempts to make the payment to that card. This whole debacle with Chase since XXXX on the debit side and now on the credit side has caused me and my family a lot of emotional distress. We are good, honest people and these banks just keep trampling over us. You would hope that even for a XXXX  vet, they would make an effort."

He graduated in the middle of the financial crisis and had difficulty finding a job. Because of the financial crisis my husband lost his job, suffered a myriad of issues and I ended up declaring bankruptcy in XXXX. 

All debtors were duly notified and ALL debts were discharged in bankruptcy except my own personal federal student loans form XXXX school. 

In XXXX I started receiving collection calls from Chase for the loan that I had cosigned for my nephew. I sent them the discharge papers from Bankruptcy and the calls stopped. They then sold out the loan to someone else who not only started the collection efforts against me but against my nephew and reported it on my credit report. I again sent the information to the company and disputed the negative reporting on my credit report. XXXX removed it but not XXXX or XXXX, which caused my score to be weighed down significantly, caused credit declines and continues to report on my report. 

XX/XX/XXXX my nephew paid off the loan. Last year when I tried to purchase a home, part of the issue of decline from various mortgage companies was student loan reporting on my credit as a charge off. I requested a copy of my credit report from XXXX and noticed that it was reporting that I owed CHASE XXXX approx. {$8800.00}. 
I contacted my nephew to get evidence that he paid off the loan from the bank. After much back and forth, they eventually sent him a letter this year. While they had received payment, they kept reporting it on my credit report even though it was discharged already in Bankruptcy in XXXX! And the fact that I had to keep disputing this on my credit report and these morons keep telling me the balances are reporting correctly is exceptionally infuriating. They have cost me in thousands in high interest payments and declines in access to credit!"

This all seemed very scammy to me so I called Chase to Verify. Long story short, I spent over an hour on the phone with about XXXX different people from Chase Bank. The first XXXX told me these documents were not sent by the Bank and that I should not fill them out and that my account was n't notated in any way that forms were required. The last person I spoke with said he recognized the forms and that they send them out for information verification but that my account was n't notated to need the forms. I was reassured by this person several times that my account would n't be closed and there was nothing further I needed to do. The organization and confusion level of this company astounds me. No one could verify that these forms were legitimately sent to me. Now here I am, two months later, with a closed account. I was never notified of the account closure. I used the card a week ago and noticed it was closed when I went to pay it yesterday. I did n't receive an email or any form of notification for that matter. When I called Chase to complain, I did n't even receive an apology. The person I spoke with informed that I received bad information from those that I spoke with at Chase and that my account was closed due to failure to send in the above mentioned forms. He also informed that the only way to get my account reopened was to mail them this information and continue to call and check on my account. He stated that they would n't be calling me and that I would personally have to push the issue. This whole situation is laughable and I would never have fathomed that JP Morgan Chase would have such pitiful customer service. I have never paid late on my account and have been a loyal customer for years. They should treat their customers better."

XXXX, it is been more than 8 months now and I am sending this lady all types of documents needed and she keeps telling me that the account is going to remain open. Although this account was opened in XXXX by whoever and it is been almost 10 years until now and with all legal documents I provided, she is not acknowledging anything and still saying that she is not convinced. Out of frustration and because I do n't want to lose the opportunity to serve my country and work with the FBI, I traveled to XXXX two months ago and I got more than XXXX pounds of all documents which might help wiping off that disaster from my report record ( Electrical, water, Gas bills, Auto payment, bank statements, rental agreement, ID card, health card and medical appointments and visits, work permit, report cards of my XXXX children whose names appear on the residency document and much more ) It is in vain everything I have done to give this lady or her manager XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, because they have no excuse at all, the only thing they keep repeating is that but the signature matches and today thousands of people are having identity theft including their signature so why me in particular. And when I asked XXXX yesterday, what is the law regarding closing this account he said that he does n't know and there is no time frame which means he can XXXX people 's lives as he likes just as easy as is. 
I told XXXX them that I am going to sue them and file a complaint against them because they have been playing around by giving me hope and every time they say if you can prove that you were outside we might think about it, and then after all what I have done they went back to day XXXX since end of last year saying that the signature does match. 
I do n't think that this is fair, they wasted more than 8 months playing fool to back me off from getting the job, I ca n't wait for their conscious to wake up while I have a family to support and I need to work. An account which I never opened goes back to almost 10 years ago is sitting there because XXXX persons have made up their mind without any evidence. I call this a discrimination and I beg you to help me out clearing them out of my report record as I will be providing you with all the documents which proofs that I was living and working XXXX outside XXXX.

I Immediately contacted chase bank and was told there was a auto withdraw system purge error on thier end, that had effected numerous accounts and my account was one effected. I was told by operator XXXX that my account was two months behind not one and they needed both months payment payed in full before they could fix the issue. ( {$970.00} ) I asked about the credit reporting issue and was told it wouldnt be effected, only it already had been effected which I advised them and was dismissed on the concerns. I was assured it would be cleared up after the two months in payments was made. The two months of payments ( {$970.00} ) was made even though their own paperwork showed only one month was actually late. 

Payment was done this same day XXXX18. After the payment was made, I logged into the on line chase account and it still showed one month behind not two and in reviewing my credit report, it was greatly effected by thier auto withdraw system error some 70 points  or so. 

Why if they were aware of the system error why did they allow these accounts to still report to the credit bureaus as late? 

When will the error be fix with the credit reporting agencies and why should I be Inconvenienced when I set up my account with auto withdraw to avoid exactly what happened, not to mention being told to pay two months contrary to what was on the notice."

A couple of weeks ago, I received balance transfer checks from Chase offering a balance transfer with 0 %. We changed my credit card number due to losing XXXX of them. Two days ago XXXX/XXXX/2016, we decided to use the balance transfer checks. Yesterday XXXX/XXXX/2016, we received notification that the check was accepted. We paid our credit cards. Yesterday, around XXXX EST, my phone started going crazy. When I looked, I seen notifications of insufficient funds. I immediately logged in to see what the issue was, and seen our balance transfer had been rejected. I called at XXXX EST, the lady was I spoke to was more focused on getting me to the credit card department than helping me stop the charges to go through. She then warm transferred me, as the credit card department told me that the check was rejected due to my account number changing when I changed my card. She advised that I still had the offer but it would take 5-7 days to post to my account. If the first lady in the checking account department would have been more focused on helping me, she could have processed a stop payment as I told her I did n't have the funds to put in my account. Before disconnecting the call the first lady I spoke to advised due to the mishap that Chase would refund the fees. I then proceeded to call XXXX XXXX to get the pending payments to be stopped, if possible, and they advised the payment was now in Process and they were not able to do this but that I could request Chase to do a stop payment. So I called Chase back, and asked for stop payments. They said it was too late that it had to be done all before XXXX EST, I advised that I was on the phone with the first advisor and that they never offered to do that or help me, so that a stop payment should be forced as when I paid those credit cards, there were funds from the balance transfer, as well as additional funds from my personal life. The point of a balance transfer is to save money and now I am forced to pay fees due to the incompetence of Chase and the first advisor I spoke to. If the issue is not resolved, I will be closing our account as I want to bank with a company that is working for the best interest of their customers. 
The incompetence with Chase and the mistakes they have made is : 1. I was never made aware that the account number changes on a credit card account when getting a new card. 
2. I was never made aware that the balance transfer checks would not work due to change card numbers. 
3. The first lady I spoke to, should have done or offered a stop payment on the charges to prevent the pending charges to go through. 
4. I received an email notification that the deposit was accepted. How can it be taken from me once it goes through? 
5. I got the notification at around XXXX EST, how does that give me anytime to resolve a matter to prevent any fees. 

I will be closing all of our accounts if the issue is not resolved. We are good Chase customers, with good history on both credit cards and checking/saving accounts. We do n't have top dollars, but our accounts are active. Every time we swipe our cards Chase is making money. Its not fair to me as a good customer trying to faithfully resolve an issue, for Chase to not be willing to help me."

During the fall of XXXX I was accumulating credit card debt and was struggling to make some monthly payments. I received 90 day past due email notifications and daily phone calls of my credit card accounts going delinquent from Chase bank of whom I had my credit cards issued from. They suggested that I enroll in a debt repayment/consolidation program through their third party XXXX XXXX to help alleviate the payment burden. I enrolled, and the Chase rep informed me that this will bring your account current as long as I made payments through them. 

From the onset of making the first payment via XXXX XXXX, the late payment notifications stopped both via email and phone calls. I continued to make payments for the next three years ( see attached ) via XXXX XXXX and never missed a payment. A few months ago I ran a credit history report and saw that Chase reported 29 missed payments for the cards that I was enrolled through the program. This shocked me as I was under the impression that I was up to date with paying down my debt. Having these missed payments on my credit report was detrimental to my goal of building back my credit. There was a missed payment that was getting carried over month to month from XX/XX/2017 which was hurting my credit score. I was never notified of this from either Chase or XXXXXXXX XXXX. Per Chase policy "" missed payment of 60 days or more Chase will begin physical mail, email, and phone communication notifying consumer of a missed payment. '' I received neither mail, email, or phone notification. In addition to this, the credit report for the missed payments shows 60 days past due for over 2 years which is a glitch/error since a true missed payment would upgrade into 90day-120 day status over that time period. I contacted Chase about this issue and even escalated it to their executive branch. They insisted there was absolutely no fault on their behalf and were not willing to remove the missed payments. I even pointed out that I received no communication from them about my account not being current but my statement was ignored. After the phone call had ended, I magically received an email from Chase for the first time in over 2 years that my credit card payment for that account was past due. This upset me even more but I made the payment to bring the account current. Today I paid off both cards via XXXX XXXX through a lump sum payoff."

I have cancelled this transfer within 10 minutes of attempting it and received a confirmation on the screen that it was cancelled. However, when I later checked my bank statement, I realized that despite the transfer being cancelled the amount was still charged to my account and never refunded. Moreover, the intended addressee has not received the money either. When I first raised this issue by calling Customer Service, I had to be transferred 2-3 times, was kept on hold for over 40 minutes and finally disconnected. Before being disconnected, I was told that the transfer was indeed cancelled and the money should be returned to me, however, the only department that can do it "" is very busy ''. When I called the second time ( on XX/XX/XXXX ), the same happened, whereby I had to speak to 2 different representatives ( the last one named XXXX ), who both confirmed that the bank has made a mistake and the money should be refunded, however, they stated ( after I was kept on hold for over 30 minutes ) that the only department that deals with it is closed at that time and I should call the next day. I requested the bank to handle this internally offline without my involvement and notify me when the refund is done since they already received and confirmed all the necessary information but was told that they are not able to do that unless I am on the phone. I consider this approach to issue resolution a "" run-around '' tactic by the bank - the procedure seems to be deliberately structured in a way to inflict the most inconvenience and pain onto the customer without any justifiable reason. If initial information from me, as well as authorization to access my account info has been already provided several times, there should not be any reason for the bank not to resolve it. If it takes them more than 10 minutes to resolve the issue, they should have a process to complete the action offline without keeping the customer on hold for ridiculous stretches of time. The result is my money has been held by the bank for over 2  months now and after spending 1.5 hrs on the phone I have not yet received the refund. I do not have ability to call every day at specific times and stay on hold for a long time because of my work schedule. I request that the bank resolves this matter asap and notifies me when it 's done. Thank you for your help!"

XXXX XXXX of XXXX delivered the bike to me the evening of XX/XX/XXXX. As he removed the bike from his truck he mentioned it was making a noise when he test drove it, but since the bike had a 2 year warranty, to drive it and see if it would work itself out. He was not gone 20 minutes and I notice a cable dangling from below the bike. I snapped a photo and sent him a text asking him if this was supposed to be hanging like this. He never responded, so I pushed the cable up inside the bike with my hand hoping it went where it was supposed to go. The same evening I notice the bike making a terrible rattling noise. I took a video and sent it to him and his reply was "" get some electrical tape and tape it up to muffle the noise '' I decided to call him the following day ( Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX ) and he begins insulting me and telling me to "" just drive the XXXX thing XXXX-XXXX miles before I call him. '' He says that I am seeking perfection and I am not going to get perfection from a plastic scooter. The following Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, we contact XXXX XXXX again and this time he begins to threaten us with saying that he is an XXXX and does not take any "" XXXX '' - we are in disbelief that we are being treated this way. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I decide to contact Chase and tell them what is transpiring with this merchant. Chase recommends that I have the bike delivered back to the merchant. I contact a professional motorcycle towing company and pay then {$180.00} to have my bike re-delivered back on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX to the merchant per Chase 's recommendation so that they can apply a charge back. The merchant went ballistic and threatened to slash the motorcycle towing company 's tires who were hired to deliver back the bikes. The same day, I receive an email from this merchant saying that he now has my bike and will be charging me $ XXXX day plus additional fee 's and will not release the merchandise until it is picked up in person with all fee 's paid, and also threatens to put the bike in the city pound. He very well could have chose to look at the bike while he had it now back in his possession, but instead decides to be ugly and hold my bike hostage after he received Chases back charges. After the merchant has his bike back, he continues to send me threatening emails. I continued to send Chase every email he had sent to keep them informed that he was holding the merchandise for ransom. After the bike is now back with merchant, Chase sends me a letter telling me that they now need a 2nd opinion letter on the merchandise in order to continue the dispute. I explain to Chase that the merchant has chosen to be ugly and will not release the bike for a second opinion. I After all, the bike was sent back because Chase asked me to send it back to the merchant. Although, Chase was well aware that the merchant was not going to work with me nor give me back my bike, because I can not get a 2nd opinion letter for my bike Chase reverses the charges back to my card so now the merchant has my bike and i am out {$3300.00} for merchandise I do not have. I am at a total loss and find it very difficult that Chase can not see the position that they placed me in when they asked me to return the bike and not expect me to pay for something I do not have. I refuse to pay for something I do not have. The bike was never registered in my name, I have no title, I have no contract from this merchant. I merely have a sales slip for my purchase in the amount of {$3300.00}. After doing additional background research on this dealer, I learn he is a convicted felon - and to be honest I am now afraid to confront him for my own safety. In summary, Chase Bank should have told me initially that a 2nd opinion letter was needed before they told me to return the bike."

Morgan and chase they informed me that my credit limit had dropped {$4500.00} dollars from {$5000.00} to {$500.00} dollars and the person I was talking to didnt have the information explaining the change. I was also never informed by the creditor that these changes were made. Since then I closed my account with J.P. Morgan and chase and am filing this complaint. Since that time my credit score has dropped another 47 points. This is completely outrageous and has absolutely ruined my credit, my score is now in the 500s after paying my balance in full. This should be illegal, I have had this account with J.P. Morgan and chase since XXXX and have never given them any reason to absolutely destroy my credit when the whole reason I was paying my balance in full is to get my credit score as high as possible so I could apply for a business card to help my business. I feel as though this practice if it is a common one is criminal and should be punishable by law. If you allow an account holder to have a allowance of {$5000.00} then you should not be able to change their limit and adversely affect their credit utilization when an account holder pays their balance in full, you should not legally be able to make these changes. If I find that what happened here was of fact illegal I will be prepared to take legal action. Especially since this incident took place during a global pandemic, this whole this stinks to me."

I deposited the cashiers check on XX/XX/XXXX at my local Chase Bank in XXXX, Kentucky. No questions were asked from the teller. I did inform her I just sold my car and she informed me the funds would be available soon. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I happened to check my bank statement online to see the {$17000.00} refunded. I called Chase immediately and all they told me that it had been refunded.

I drove to the chase bank I had made the physical deposit and spoke to their acting manager. She was able to pull up the check and told me someone higher up in Chase deemed the check altered. I informed her this was for selling my car and that I no longer had the car in my possession. I also informed her that the buyer stated his loan account was not active and that is why the cashier check did not go through. I was already under stress with thinking I was just scammed but the acting manager reassured me things were likely fine and that his bank would sort it out. 

XX/XX/XXXX I ended up calling the bank on the cashier check myself and gave them the check #. Their teller informed me that the check was a fraudulent check and was not one of theirs. 

I was furious. I was just scammed out of {$17000.00} and lost my car. I immediately filed a police report and went to another Chase bank and spoke to their manager who immediately saw what the check was missing. He admitted that the teller should have caught this mistake. 
I am baffled as to why Chase did not call this other bank to verify the funds when I was depositing that day? I have not been able to sleep or do anything but worry. I have been doing my own investigation on the case, and feel if Chase would have caught this back on XX/XX/XXXX I would have been able to start looking for my car sooner."

In XXXX I received a bill from MCS for $ XXXX. I called to inquire about the bill and MCS told me they showed no balance due and my account should be closed. Then they sent me a paid in full letter. All of this is documented through conversations with MCS and documents I uploaded to XXXX Auto Insurance. One month later I received another bill for the same amount.

In XXXX XXXX, I received another letter, this time from United Recovery Systems claiming I owed MCS / JP Morgan Chase Bank over {$900.00} and was delinquent in paying it. I called MCS, who only told me my account had been transferred to the collection agency and when I asked why I was forwarded to voicemail, to which I have not heard any response from. I then called URS myself to learn more. URS told me that this $ XXXX debt is completely unrelated to the {$700.00} previously communicated to me and that the only information they had about the charge was that it was an insurance deductible. I confirmed with XXXX and MCS that I have no outstanding payments for my insurance ( in fact XXXX also thought the claim was closed ). 
I did not get any notice of this $ XXXX debt from MCS or Chase Bank before it was considered a "" long outstanding '' debt and I have been very communicative about any other written notices received. 
As I have not been given any real reason as to why this debt is owed and I have been told numerous times that my account is paid in full and I have zero outstanding insurance payments or deductibles I am disputing this charge. I have already sent notification of this by mail to Mazda Capital Services, XXXX, and the Office of the Texas XXXX. I wish to submit my complaint and dispute here to official record it with the CFPB and ensure it is addressed. Thank you!"

With no written response from Chase, I learned that Chase reported me to the credit reporting agencies and my credit score dropped from the 800s where it has been for as long as I can remember to the low 700 's. Then on XX/XX/XXXX they sent me notice that they were reducing my credit limit on my other Chase card to {$500.00}. While not certain, I believe it had been somewhere between {$10000.00} and {$20000.00} prior to this slap on the wrist.

On XX/XX/XXXX a Chase representative called me and said TransUnion, apparently in response to my written request for a fraud alert, had blocked the account as a fraudulent account and removed it from my credit file.

The attempted withdrawal was made at a Chase ATM at the Chase Branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX. 

However after I inputted the details, the {$950.00} DID NOT dispense, but DID show up on my account as a charge. A {$47.00} cash advance fee also showed up on my account. 

I immediately called Chase 's assistance line on the back of my card, and they instructed me to open a dispute and the cash would be reinstated and removed as a charge, and it was nothing to worry about. They told me that this was not that unusual. 

I lodged a dispute the next day and the charge was momentarily removed from my card. I was then traveling for 2 weeks and assumed the matter would be handled. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed the charge had returned to my card. I called Chase disputes and was told that the case was 'closed ' and I WOULD be charged for the transaction. Obviously, I was extremely upset at this and told them they needed to reopen the case. I also told them I wanted the case escalated and handled immediately. I also received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX saying the ATM machine was in balance at the time of the transaction and the charge would stand. As I said, I escalated the dispute and was furious. I was told I needed to write a letter to have the matter reopened. 

On approx XX/XX/XXXX a Chase Branch Complaint Escalation officer employee named XXXX XXXX  contacted me. I told XXXX that they needed to do a security camera check and proper audit on the ATM that would confirm I did not receive the cash. 

On approx XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called me back to confirm that their security camera and internal audit had indeed found that I DID NOT RECEIVE THE CASH. 
The charge would be removed in a matter of days. She specifically said they did a camera check and found that I did not receive the cash, and that the ATM audit found the ATM was {$950.00} over. 
I was relieved, but was now wary of Chase 's systems and asked her for a copy of the relevant documents confirming I didn't receive the cash. She told me she could not provide me the documents ( Chase bank apparently refusing to be transparent ), but told me she would send me a letter but the letter would have to be 'vetted by the Chase legal team '. Again concerning. Anyway, I assumed the money would shortly be back in my account. 

I did receive the letter dated XXXX XXXX ( attached ). 
The letter states ( contradictorily ) : "" This letter confirms our conversation and that we reached a resolution regarding your case number XXXX XXXX. '' It refuses to state any specifics or what I had asked for. 
On the next page of the letter, in contradiction to the previous statement, it says : "" Your claim is currently under review by our Credit Card Disputes team. The necessary documents have been forwarded to this team for review ''. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX back but was apparently reassigned to another employee ( I did not record the name of this particular employee ). The money was STILL not back in my account. I again asked for the matter to be escalated to achieve a quick resolution, and that given they have the evidence this matter should be resolved quickly. I was assured it would be resolved and the money returned. I asked if the employee had all the relevant documents. She said she did not. She also said she was in a different department to XXXX. This was now extremely frustrating. 

I asked her to get XXXX on the phone while I stayed on the phone. A XXXX way call then ensued. I asked XXXX to send the new employee the documents proving I did not receive the money. They each said they could not because the employee could only receive faxes, and XXXX could only send emails!! 

This is not a joke. Honest to XXXX this was the discussion going on between them. The level of incompetence was mind-boggling. These 2 Chase employees could not send each other documents because one needed to do it by fax, and the other could only send by email. We resolved for XXXX to email the documents proving I did not receive the money to the Branch Manager, XXXX XXXX. XXXX would then fax the documents to the new department to get the matter resolved. 

I then went into the branch to confirm that XXXX received the documents. XXXX said she did receive the documents and had forwarded them to the new disputes escalation department. I asked her for a copy of the documents, she again refused and said there is a line stating on the letters "" not to be provided to consumer ''. I told XXXX this is concerning. Not only is Chase not handling this in a timely manner, but they are refusing to be transparent and provide evidence that you have, proving I did not receive that money. I told her I believed that was because Chase is protecting itself legally. She said "" well I can clearly see you didn't receive the money, and if you needed to subpoena me, I would have to tell the truth '', exact quote. 
She was quite confused why the matter was taking so long and to her credit was honestly very supportive. She has checked in several times to see if the matter had been resolved. Her details are : XXXX XXXX, Branch Mgr Vice President, XXXX, XXXX She has a copy of the documents proving I did not receive the money. She has been helpful. 

Anyway, I assumed the matter was resolved and I was waiting for the money to be reinstated. But it simply never was. I kept calling back and was told either the money will be back in the account shortly, or the matter was still pending with no more details. 

On approx XX/XX/XXXX, I had had enough of the 'pending ' case. The money had still not been reinstated to my account. I returned to the branch manager XXXX because she seemed to have an actual interest in resolving the matter. We escalated the matter again this time to the Executive Branch. I was told this was the highest possible department of escalation. 

My assigned officer was XXXX XXXX ( XXXX # XXXX ). I was assured the matter would be resolved promptly. When I called back to check in over a week later, I was told XXXX was on vacation ( seriously ), and I was now assigned to her assistant ( XXXX XXXX ext XXXX ). The case number here was XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX seemed again disinterested in resolving the matter promptly and said again, the matter was still being researched and it takes as long as it takes. When I asked her why it was still pending given you have the documents to prove I did not receive the money she said "" because it was out of a credit card account, we are researching from where we reimburse you the money '' or some similar wording. Again, I'm not joking. What she appeared to be saying was that they knew I didn't receive the money from their own ATM, from their own Chase account, but they needed to research how to reimburse the money. 

And to top it all off, on XX/XX/XXXX, the {$47.00} cash advance fee was finally refunded! ( see letter ) But the original {$950.00} has STILL NOT been refunded. 

So to recap - On XX/XX/2018 I tried to withdraw {$950.00} from my Chase credit card account, from a Chase ATM.

The money didn't dipense but I was charged. 
In the ensuing 70 DAYS Chase has gone in circles and delayed. They have the evidence to confirm I did not receive the cash and that evidence can be requested from the branch manager, but they have still not reinstated the money into my account. Again, it has been 70 DAYS and countless hours spent on my part for their mistake. 

Faithfully, XXXX XXXX"

None of these were identified until on or about the XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX after 3 other transactions were attempted on the same account.  On the XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from Chase stating that they wanted to verify a quickpay transaction right after I had made a quickpay transaction to my wife. My transaction was {$1500.00}, Chase identified another transaction that was submitted at almost the exact same time which triggered the call for Aprox {$1300.00}. This one was denied and a verification call was made to me, I identified it as Fraud and went immediately to the branch nearest to me in XXXX, Tx. I had to sign affidavits stating that it was fraud on my account, shut down my two business accounts and open two new ones. 
After trying to set up my new online profile with new login and password I had to call Chase for assistance in adding my wife as a payee. Chase customer service was reviewing my previous list of payees and stated that they could see all 5 of them, I ask them to read the list of names because there were only 4 that I was aware of ( 1 fraudulent on the XX/XX/XXXX,  my wife and two other that I paid several years back ), they read the names and one that I didnt know was listed. I was told that on the XX/XX/XXXXr 5 transactions were processed to a XXXX XXXX ( fraudulent ) via Chase Quickpay with XXXX equaling {$4900.00}. At that point I had to revisit the local branch again in XXXX, tx and sign another affidavit stating this was unauthorized and fraud. I requested all statements back to XX/XX/2018 to verify any and all transactions. I found no other questionable transations on Quickpay prior to the XX/XX/XXXX incidents. 
Two days later, I got my online portal set up for my quickpay again adding only my wife as a payee. I made a test transfer of {$20.00} to her to verify that it worked. The next day a XXXX XXXX added themselves to my list of payees and made a {$1300.00} transfer to herself. All logins and passwords were changed as requested by Chase, both phone and computer ran malware and anti-virus as requested. I had to again go to the nearest branch, this time I went to the local branch in XXXX, tx and closed the second set of business accounts and open another two. 
A few days later I got an alert via text that a transaction was attempted on my wifes account but was rejected due to insufficient funds. At that point we discontinued any online banking on my personal banking. I notified the bank of her account being compromised. 
The bank issued a temporary credit to my account for the 5 fraudulent transaction on the 1st by XXXX XXXX and for the XX/XX/XXXX fraudulent transaction for {$1300.00} to XXXX XXXX. I was told that after the investigation was complete that the credits would be made permanent, assuming they were found to be fraudulent. 
On the XX/XX/2018 I received an alert that a reversal of {$4900.00} was taken from my account. I called Chase Claims department and asked what has happened and I was told that the investigation was complete and it was found that the first 5 transactions on XX/XX/XXXX were from the same IP address as other transactions that were authorized. I asked for the IP addresses and was told that they couldnt give me that information. I told the Claims department that I wanted the claim to be elevated and appealed because it was fraud and unauthorized. I was assured then that it would be elevated and reevaluated. On the XX/XX/XXXX I visited the local branch by my home and spoke to the Branch Manager whom put me in contact with the claims department again. When we attempted to follow up on the claim I was told that the claim had not be elevated as I was told it would on the XX/XX/XXXX. After back and forth conversations the Claims department initially stated that without supporting documentation they could not elevate the claim, but could not tell me what was needed on my behalf. After asking again for the IP addresses that were stated to be the reason for denial of the claim I was told that they could mail it to me and it was be 7-10 business days before I would get it. Then I was told that sense the claim was denied on the XX/XX/XXXX I had 24 hrs to submit supporting documentation before the 30 day time line was up. To date I still have not received a letter of denial from the bank. After arguing the insufficient timeframe to respond I was told she would have a supervisor contact me later that day. At around XXXX I received a call from a XXXX XXXX from the claims escalation department stating that she would personally see that it was sent to the Manager of her department and that I would get a follow up call the next day or the following Monday. 
The main question is with all of the documented fraud and the approved claim for {$1300.00}, how is this claim for 5 separate transactions on the same day denied. In a less than 3 weeks my accounts were hacked repeatedly, reported and documented. It isnt an individual claim issue all of the tie together."

Since there was no reference to my property - let alone a lien on my property - in Chase records I asked him to write a letter stating that there was no lien on the property and to notify the XXXX County Clerk so their records could be updated and to give me a copy of the letter for my files. He told me that he could not do that. However, he assured me that he could get someone at Chase to file the paperwork necessary to remove the lien from my property. I provided XXXX XXXX with a copy of the page referencing the lien that XXXX sent me. 
I have contacted XXXX XXXX several times since XXXX XXXX and each time he has assured me that he was working on the issue and that it would be resolved within weeks.

In that email he also wrote that "" Chase told me the cost to do personally is high. I will be contacting XXXX XXXX to get more information and this process and then I will get back to you sometime this afternoon. "" I have not heard from XXXX XXXX - or anyone else at Chase Bank - about this since then. 
I will attach copies of the PDF I received from XXXX referencing the lien and copies of the email exchanges I had with XXXX XXXX, if possible.

Chase researched its records and provided a copy of the original application used to assign account responsibility. Neither the handwriting nor signature on that document is mine. Further, though bearing only a single signature, Chase nevertheless contends that the account was jointly held with another person with no supporting documentation. 

In XXXX 2016, I advised Chase of its understandable error, providing the company with copies of the same documents they sent to to me from its own records and additional documents in my possession with comparator handwriting that would demonstrate the mistake they made. In this regard, it was my belief that even an untrained eye would be capable of differentiation between the two samples. 

In my letter I asked, again, that Chase remove my name from responsibility for the debt, notify credit reporting agencies of this action, and to amend a false report to the IRS resulting in a XXXX form to me. 

Chase has yet to offer a response of any manner. While the sum involved is insignificant to the bank, the loss since "" written off '' and perhaps otherwise irrelevant to it, continuing existence of incorrect records of the misplaced debt continue to have real ramifications to me. Not only was my tax burden greatly increased last year, but a marginal creditworthiness continues to follow me. This issue is one which I would like to resolve in as timely a manner as possible."

Chase had advised I can send payment through XXXX using phone number or email. Because I wanted to make sure it got to the right person I inputted Name, phone number and e-mail. I triple checked everything before hitting submit and everything was correct. On XX/XX/XXXX I get a call from my landlord saying that he has not received my rent payment. I obviously was humiliated and called Chase right away to find out what is going on. They verified the transaction and said that XXXX sent payment using the phone number. I asked why since I inputted email as well and they told me the system just chooses one since they only need one. He searched XXXX 's data base with the phone number I used and said that it was sent to a XXXX XXXX who has XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was confused because I thought it was only within Chase and he said no, it is with all banks. So I said I wanted to file a dispute because it wasn't suppose to go to her and I was very disappointed that Chase is promoting an app that does not even verify all the information to make sure it is being sent to the right person. They told me that it takes about 5 days to investigate so I waited. I called Chase on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX to see what was the outcome because I have not received a call from anyone. I come to find out that they closed the claim ( again, without calling me ) because they determined it was a fraudulent claim and it was "" customer initiated ''. I asked to speak to a supervisor and she was terrible telling me that it was my fault because I entered the wrong phone number. I told her that is incorrect, it is the right phone number for my landlord I don't understand why this lady is using his phone number. Which just shows you how insecure XXXX is! The next day on XX/XX/XXXX I went to a Chase branch and spoke with the Manager XXXX, he called customer service about my situation and he was as surprised as I was! He didn't understand how they do not verify the person we are going to send money to! He said that at this point we can not call XXXX because they will direct us back to the bank, and the bank can't do anything because it is a "" third party ''. He said the only thing we can do is sent a request to the same phone number through XXXX for {$1400.00} and see if the person will pay it back, which I did and included a memo saying it was my rent money. Unfortunately, they did not return the money to me. I want to the XXXX XXXX XXXX branch after to see if they can give me any info on this person that received my money or any idea what I should do and they said due to security and privacy, we can not give you any info on the person. I called the dispute dept at Chase to see if they can escalate my problem and spoke to a supervisor named XXXX and she said that XXXX contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX to contact the recipient but the retrieval of funds was unsuccessful which meant either the person is not cooperating or they could not get a hold of them. I am in disbelief that a Bank can promote such an app. I thought my money was safe and I though I was backed up by my bank but unfortunately Chase is just wiping their hand on the customer and not doing anything about it. Now I am on the verge of being evicted due to not paying my rent. I do not make money like this everyday that I can make a double payment!"

I called them and told them about this and was told I agreed to this amount.

As for the XXXX I imagine I am stuck paying that but my bank will credit me any overdraft fees. Now I have to go and open another checking account so that XXXX XXXX does not have my backing information and continue to deduct any more checks."

For 4 weeks, I have tried to get money disbursed. Rather than disburse the funds in accordance with their own policy, chase continues to demand additional information ( much of which does not exist or is not required ) as a way to delay paying these funds. I have asked to speak to someone who can review the file, approve payment, and issue the check within XXXX business days. Chase refuses to put me in contact with such a person, and insists that it can't be done. Then, they demand more documentation further delaying the process, while telling me there is no way to move the process forward. For example, after being told payment would be issued by XX/XX/XXXX, I was told several times it was being processed before being told on XX/XX/XXXX that it had been cancelled. Chase then demanded a signed contract ( which does not exist ). I submitted an invoice from the contractor. Chase insisted it had to be signed. I complied with that request and asked to speak with someone who could review it, approve it, and issue the check. Chase refused, and then called the contractor and demanded a copy of his license. GC 's are not licensed in Texas, so chase then asked for the license numbers of any subcontractors. He provided that, and chase responded by demanding a copy of the license, a publicly available document from the state of Texas website. Even though this process has been going on for 4 weeks, and chase has had all information it requested for 4 days, it refuses to place me in contact with someone who can approve the disbursement. My expectation is that chase will demand additional information to continue delaying payment since they refuse to put me in contact with a person who has the authority to approve payment. Feel free to contact XXXX XXXX at chase bank in Georgia, XXXX. She candidly admits she can't resolve my problem, but refuses to transfer me to someone who can."

The automated system is behind on reporting the correct amount. On my previous call in XXXX the system did not report any payment due at all.

The customer service department failed to address any concerns regarding the automated system not matching what they were saying. 

This is my first missed payment of any kind in 10 years and as a creditor the automated system should report the correct information so consumers can rely in that information to make timely payments. 

It's an unfair and deceptive practice to state a smaller amount owed in the automated system and subsequently charge fees and negatively impact the customer 's credit score if the he/she was misinformed on the amount owed by the Chase Auto loan Automated system."

The problems were pertaining to their dispute department with the uneducated and sometimes nasty agents I had to speak with as well as Chase 's Customer Service Department. I have to call several times to try to get a representative that can assist me and many times have to ask for a supervisor to assist me properly. Most recently on Friday, XX/XX/2017 I had requested to speak to a supervisor about a purchase of a cell phone case that I should have received that day but did n't. I explained the situation to her and she said she was crediting my account immediately for {$5.00}. Tonight, ( XX/XX/2017 ) when I checked my account on line, I did not see the credit ; therefore, I called Chase 's Customer Service Department to question the status of the credit. I was told by XXXX, the agent I spoke to that no credit was applied to my account and that the supervisor 's notes did n't mention the credit. XXXX was also referring to accounts that I am not aware of and also had the incorrect phone number for which I had updated the new number many times. I was not satisfied with the agent 's handling of the call so I then asked to speak to a supervisor and was connected to XXXX who tried to assist me but unfortunately XXXX XXXX said their systems were down and he could take my complaint but could n't provide me any account information because of the system update. I questioned as to why XXXX a few minutes prior was able to give me information, albeit not all accurate. He said he should n't have given me any information because when the systems are updating the information may not be correct. So, once again, I am going through this vicious cycle with Chase. I did ask XXXX, the supervisor, to please listen to the recorded call that I had with the prior supervisor who verified several times that she was immediately going to issue a {$5.00} credit to my account because I feel the supervisor misrepresented me about the credit. 
At this time, I have more than adequately provided Chase with any updated personal information that is needed for my account ; therefore, it should be accurate. Although I have provided them my current phone number many times, they are still calling me on a prior number that I very rarely use. They are also leaving messages on that phone which I hardly check. 
How many times should be considered reasonable and necessary that I have to contact Chase customer service and their dispute departments to get a simple issue resolved?"

I called telephone customer service on XX/XX/2016 because I was looking to pay off my credit card balance in full. The credit card statement had a balance of {$990.00} with a due date of XX/XX/2016. This balance included a Late Fee of {$39.00} and Interest Charge of {$12.00}. I requested for the fee and interest to be refunded. The representative agreed to do so as a one time courtesy adjustment since it was the first ever fees charged to my credit card. I told the representative that I would like to pay my card to a XXXX  balance and did not want to over pay and be left with a credit owed. I was instructed by the representative to minus the late fee and interest charge from the statement balance amount and pay that amount because after the fees are credited then the account would balance itself to a XXXX  balance. 

I paid the amount of {$940.00} on XX/XX/2016. I found out after some time that the fees refund adjustments were never credited. Which caused my account to have a balance left over of the late fee and interest charge that were not refunded as promised. And for multiple months late fees and interest fees were accumulating on my account by being charged fees and interest on top of fees and interest. Ultimately my account was charged off with a balance of {$200.00}. This charge off amount completely consists of bank fees. 

I am disputing this amount due to chase bank clerical error. I previously disputed this with the credit bureau but my dispute was denied. I am writing this so you can understand my situation in detail. I request that you properly investigate and correct this. Thank You."

They are insisting that it stay open and continue to rack up annual fees until I pay off the fees that they have been racking up for years, even though I have never used the account and have repeatedly requested they cancel the account for almost a decade.     Many years ago I applied and was approved for a business line of credit with Chase Bank , ( a t the time it was Washington Mutual I believe, but ca n't say for sure ). I never used it and after the first statement came in with a fee of {$150.00} I asked the account be closed because I did n't like the interest rate or the annual fee they were charging. I assumed it was taken care of.  <P/> Then a year later I received another annual statement with another {$150.00} fee, and several times after that. Bottom line is I have been trying to get them to close this account and stop racking up fees for years.  In 2013 they f inally waived the fees and, again, I assumed they had finally closed the account and I was done with it.  <P/> But no, the fees kept piling on even though I had NEVER used this line of credit and did n't want it.   Last month I received ANOTHER annual statement and the fees had now accumulated to {$750.00}! This time I went into the bank and hit the roof. The lady at the branch I do business with had me sign a document to close the account and was going to try again to have those fees waived.   Today, I got a call from the branch manager saying they can not close the account until I pay the {$750.00} in fees. In other words, If I do n't pay the fees for a line of credit I 've never used, the account will continue and I will be charged {$150.00} per year into infinity until I pay them off at some point, and then at that point they will close the account and stop the annual charges.   This smells like a scam, or at the very least, another unethical banking practice. Here 's why :  1.  Had I used the line of credit, say for {$100.00} charge, and failed to pay it, they would have closed my account immediately. In this case, they refuse to close my account unless I pay them off, saying the account will remain active and will continue accumulating fees until some day into the future when I decide to pay them whatever they 've racked up in charges. Interestingly, the statement show no "" past due '' amount, yet they refuse to close the account unless I settle the past due amount.  <P/>  2.  When I applied for the LOC, I did not have to go into the bank to do it. But they refuse to close the account unless I come in and jump through hoops. So I did, and now they are saying they ca n't close it until I pay off their fees, so the fees will just keep accumulating. It 's a quagmire situation whereby the customer loses no matter what.  <P/>  3. T he annual statements they send me continues to accumulate fees and is now {$750.00}. I have never paid them anything. Interestingly though, it has never shown a due date or past due date, which I can only assume they do to prevent the account from being closed due to non-payment. This allows them to just continue accumulating fees with the apparent expectation that some day I 'll be forced to pay their "" extortion '' money, since there is no mechanism to flag the account for closure and collection. Talk about a long-term financial incentive for Chase Bank to not close the dormant account.  <P/> I plan to make a big deal out of this because it reminds me of the many practices banks have been in trouble for in the past, and I do n't intend to let it go until they stop ripping off consumers."

Their actions have led to a {$100.00} increase in charges and a negative credit rating after 40 years of perfect credit. try and summarize what happened. 

In XXXX, I had some work done on my truck and incurred a large bill The credit card bill for that month was {$5100.00} XXXX I have a credit limit of {$30000.00} ) due on XX/XX/XXXX. While this is high, it is not my highest bill.I have an automatic payment plan set up with XXXX XXXX XXXX so I have never had a late Chase credit card payment and I always pay the balance in full. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I deposited a {$20000.00} cashiers check from my other bank ( XXXX  ). On XX/XX/XXXX, Chase reported that I had insufficient funds to cover the credit card bill ( see attachment as I should have had over {$21000.00} in the account I called XXXX XXXX XXXX immediately on the Friday, XX/XX/XXXX and was told that XXXX did have the check and had had it since XXXX XXXX. I was annoyed but the service person promised me he would post it to the account that evening. On Monday XX/XX/XXXX, Chase contacted me about insufficient funds. I told them the money had posted Friday, XX/XX/XXXX. Apparently, it hadnt but XXXX promised it would post to my account that evening. My first complaint is with XXXX XXXX XXXX and how long it took to credit my account when I made a deposit with a cashiers check. When I make a charge or payment, the amount is immediately deducted from my account so I dont understand why it would take over a week to get funds XXXX  held in my name. 

Because there were still problems, I contacted Chase immediately ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and we set up a bank transfer. For some reason, the bank numbers were incorrect ( I was told XX/XX/XXXX that the routing and account numbers were reversed ). Again, Chase contacted me and I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX to see what the problem might be. At that point, XXXX XXXX XXXX initiated a 3-way telephone conversation to resolve the issue. Both Chase and XXXX XXXX XXXX refunded late payment/insufficient funds charges. I thought the issue had been resolved. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to make a payment for a XXXX airline ticket. ( Note this is a {$450.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card ). Chase rejected the charge for possible fraud. While still online booking, I called Chase and stated it was not a fraudulent charge. I retried booking. XXXX XXXX, however, cancelled my reservation because Chase denied the charge. I had to rebook at a {$100.00} higher fee. This is my second complaint. When speaking to the customer service person at Chase, I got no help or acknowledgement of the problem. That service person was condescending and rude and through up the late payment from XXXX ( though she did acknowledge it had been resolved ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Chase cancelled my credit card (! ) for : Rapid increase in revolving balances ( my note : there were no revolving balances and the account was paid in full ) Recently returned payments on one or more of you accounts with Chase ( my note : this had already been resolved and Chase returned fee related to this ). 

My third complaint is with the cancelation of a credit card that was paid in full and in good standing The cancelation was reported to the credit agencies and now my credit score has been lowered. 

I spoke to a number of Chase customer service people about this. Nobody could tell me why the card was cancelled except that it was related to the above. They all acknowledged that both issues had been resolved. 

I believe that the customer service representative at Chase in a moment of petty vindictiveness initiative the cancellation. I am not sure how this passed any subsequent review as the account was paid in full. In fact, anyone looking into my many years credit history with Chase would see a perfect payment record ( we also have a mortgage with Chase ) ; they could also see that the issue had been resolved. 

I have spent many hours with both XXXX XXXX XXXX and Chase. It is frustrating that long-term, financially responsible customers are treated in such a manner. XXXX  XXXX XXXX personnel told me XXXX was perfectly within its rights to hold onto my money for over a week before crediting my account. I think this is unfair and, if this is the case, laws ought to be enacted to stop this thievery. Likewise, because Chase refused to accept the XXXX XXXX payment, I had to pay {$100.00} more for the ticket ( even though my contact with Chase acknowledging the charge was immediate ). Finally, the cancelation of the card before XXXX meant that I could not use the card for XXXX XXXX sales ( nor for other travel related to the XXXX trip ). This meant I lost valuable points. 

In closing, I would like to say that I am an educated, high status customer with an excellent credit history. If banks treat me this way, I cant imagine how those with fewer resources are treated.

The reason argue to denying this car financing to my uncle according to this letters was as follow : "" Applicant resides outside of the US or has non US/XXXX Mailing Address ''. 
This application XXXX was did for me, XXXX XXXX XXXX, the nephew of XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
But, I am not had the score demand by the dealer to get the car financing at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. So, the dealer suggest me to get another relatives with good score to do it through them. 
So, my uncle XXXX XXXX XXXX that live before in XXXX, USA for more than 15 years but he is living now in XXXX XXXX, USA called XXXX XXXX XXXX the Sales & Leasing Consultant in the car dealer XXXX XXXX XXXX to the following telephone number XXXX and also to his cell phone XXXX to apply for the car financing on behalf of me becasuse my uncle have the score. After XXXX hour, my uncle XXXX applied online through the following website of the dealer : XXXXXXXXSo, XXXX XXXX called me and my uncle XXXX the same day to said that my uncle XXXX have an score of XXXX in XXXX Scale and also that he received by email the application of my uncle completed for the car financing. So, XXXX XXXX said that he could send the rest of the documents for car financing application to my uncle by XXXX to my uncle in XXXX XXXX to be signed by him in XXXX XXXX, USA to proceed with the car financing on his name but to be drive for me in XXXX, USA. 
Finally, we do n't more about them after this letter, so my uncle and I understood that JP MORGAN CHASE BANK and the Dealer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Legla Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX ) both in USA with this act was violating the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution and a lots of laws that apply for the US XXXX ( XXXX States ) and also its XXXX as XXXX XXXX. 
The point is that my uncle and I, we are US Citizen by born. So, to our best knowledge and understanding this XXXX entities, JP Morgan and the dealer XXXX are discriminating against me and my uncle to approved a vehicle financing car just for our national origin ( XXXX XXXX ) and not for financial requirements as required the US Rule of Law ( good credit, score, income, etc ). 
Also, we understood that they ( JP Morgan and the dealer XXXX ) are breaking the interstate commerce protected by this amendment because the reason that they established in the letter to rejected the application of my uncle was : "" '' Applicant resides outside of the US or has non US/XXXX Mailing Address ''. This reason to our best knowledge is a flagrant violation of the 14th Amendment of US Constitution that applied to XXXX XXXX as US XXXX and as part of US interstate commerce. Because XXXX XXXX under US Rule of Law is part of US is not a foreign country, so XXXX XXXX is part of USA according to USPS and also US Costitution and a lots of federal laws. So, legally talking, my uncle reside inside in USA not outside of US, legally talking, although XXXX XXXX is geographically separated of US XXXX but is not legally separately. 
I hope you could help us to resolve this unacceptable civil rights and US Constitution violations to me and my uncle as US citizen and to restore our respect and privileges and immunities as US Rule of Law mandated."

My personal information was compromised in XXXX and every since then I have had people open all sorts of accounts in my name using my correct personal information that was obtained from the identity theft. This debt that they are trying to collect from me is absolutely not mine and they have defamed my character by listing and continuing to list this fraudulent information against me. A part of defaming my character they are also continuing to violate the FCRA Section 605B by refusing to remove this information they know to be fraudulent from my credit reports."

When we realized this happened the next morning, we immediately called Chase ( along with the other CC companies ) and logged into our account to see {$1000.00} had been withdrawn at an ATM, and XXXX XXXX purchases totaling over {$2600.00} had been made between the hours of XXXX and XXXX on XX/XX/18. We then went to the police station and filed a police report ( XXXX PD case number XXXX ). 

Initially, Chase gave us a temporary credit to cover the costs but last week determined that they would not cover the claim and reversed the credits back out of our account. Even worse, they froze our savings account so we couldn't transfer money out to cover the overdrafts until we called and BEGGED them to unfreeze it for a few minutes. 

Their reason for the claim denial was that a PIN was used to make the purchases. We believe ( as did the sergeant who filed our police report ) that my husband was followed and targeted - watching him enter his PIN at a XXXX OR this was an inside job. 

Chase was negligent on several security measures : 1 - ATM Daily Limits. The thief was able to take out over {$1000.00} in ATM withdrawals, exceeding the daily limits on the account. 
2 - Access to linked accounts. The thief was able to re-point my husband 's Visa debit card to my checking account ( where there was more money ) and spend against it. 
3 - 11 unusual transactions were made in the middle of the night ( XXXX ) in a town we have never visited and at every one of them they took {$100.00} in cash back. Their fraud detection systems never caught them. And the cashier at XXXX was likely in on it - 9 of those transactions were at the same store in XXXX, IL. 

Last week, we received a tattered envelope with his water-soaked wallet with his license and insurance cards. The note said the wallet had been found on a street corner in downtown XXXX. Credit cards and cash were missing, of course. They took what they wanted and dumped the rest. 

Having been a customer with Chase for many years ( close to 20 ), we are so frustrated with this situation. Chase has refused to research the ATM or XXXX purchases and claims no responsibility in protecting us."

( this being the same branch both myself and my wife bank with ). 
She was looking to open a new credit card utilizing her sole name and credit. After completing the application and being approved for the card she was "" convinced '' to have her husband ( Myself ) as an "" Authorized user '' on this account to "" gain more points ''. My wife specifically asked to Chase at that time, that this would have no impact or be reported against myself ( her husbands credit ). About 20 days later I was informed by my own credit monitoring company that an account by Chase has been opened AND reported against MY credit showing a balance etc. - I asked my wife about this and she was adamant that the person who took her application at Chase clearly stated that this new card account with Chase in no way would have any affect or be reported to any credit agency against her spouse ( Myself ). 
My wife reached out to the individual at Chase that took her application, who was totally Un-Aware and informed her this would not be reported against any authorized users credit. After speaking to the Branch Manager ( XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX he informed me that he was well aware of this going against the authorized users credit, and WAS written on the form in the small print that my wife had signed and agreed to. His only answer was to close the account against my name and told me it would "" Probably '' come off my credit report. - When I asked for a letter simply stating that this account was opened and reported against my own credit without MY authorization he responded with "" I can not write a letter "". 
This Branch and the managers at CHASE need to be held accountable and stopped, for opening probably thousands of accounts and having a direct impact on an individuals "" Authorized users '' credit without their knowledge of an account even existing. We all know how precious and important it is these days in this credit environment and for Chase to blatantly lie to customers is simply not acceptable. - I am still trying to get a letter from Chase to get this removed entirely from my own credit. The officers at Chase taking such applications who supposedly "" Know their Customers '' should have a fiduciary responsibility to their customers to read verbatim the part in the application that discusses who the opening of this account will affect credit wise, be it the main card holder or any authorized user they want to add."

Non-holders in possession ' '' must demonstrate possession of the note and that the transferor was the holder at the time of the transfer to the transferee in order to enforce the note ''. 

Federal Complaint Case No. XXXX and Case No. XXXX XXXX XXXX and their corporate clients defaulted. They also defaulted in the Circuit Court of XXXX County. 

CHASE attempted foreclosure three ( 3 ) times and are in violation of TILA, FDCPA, FCRA. 
They are guilty of mortgage fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, identity theft, altering and forging of my signature on mortgage Notes, harassment and invasion of privacy. 
They are attempting to collect a debt on behalf of XXXX XXXX a deceased corporation. 
Violation under 18 U.S.C. 335 : US Code - Section 335 : Circulation of obligations of expired corporations, Whoever, being a director, officer, or agent of a corporation created by Act of Congress, the charter of which has expired, or trustee thereof, or an agent of such trustee, or a person having in his possession or under his control the property of such corporation for the purpose of paying or redeeming its notes and obligations, knowingly issues, reissues, or utters as money, or in any other way knowingly puts in circulation any bill, note, check, draft, or other security purporting to have been made by any such corporation, or by any officer thereof, or purporting to have been made under authority derived there from, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. Willful Violation and they are all guilty. 

XXXX XXXX unethical attorneys are fully aware and deliberately failed to disclose to the court that JP MORGAN CHASE was sued by the FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS XX/XX/XXXX, after their third attempt to fraudulently foreclose, for deficiencies with these same documents used in the previous cases. 
Therefore these documents can never be used in another foreclosure case. 
XXXX XXXX is fully aware because they represented CHASE each time and this is why they changed the name of the debt collector to XXXX XXXX to cover up the fact that they are using the same counterfeit documents they used when they represented JP MORGAN CHASE. They deliberately failed to disclose that they are representing JP MORGAN CHASE and not XXXX XXXX. They also changed the name of the debt collector to defraud me and to deceive the court. Attorneys behavior is dishonest, unethical and they are guilty of deliberate fraudulent concealment and misrepresentations. 

Therefore I claim all rights and protections provided for in Law, starting with the Verification of Debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and under TILA. 
They know just sending a bill for an amount and a letter is not verification of debt. 
JP MORGAN CHASE - REPEATEDLY Reported false information to XXXX and XXXX Credit Bureaus under a subsidiary called XXXX. They are guilty of false reporting, Identity Theft, Civil Conspiracy, INVASION OF PRIVACY and MORTGAGE FRAUD. 
According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), they are required by federal law to verify through the physical verification of the ORIGINAL signed consumer contract any and all accounts they post on my credit. They are in violation. 

CHASE have persisted in their unlawful harassment and unethical conduct and proceeded to unlawfully sell/transfer the mortgage secretly without an appraisal and without my knowledge or consent. 
They use this method to place different entity names on the mortgage! 

All allegations and assertions made by CHASE, was done without my knowledge or consent and are specifically and generally DENIED. 
Such notification with Full Disclosure is mandatory by UCC and SEC Regulations, since the Promissory Note and the Mortgage package is a combined Financial instrument involved in Commercial Trade. 

XXXX letter dated XX/XX/XXXX Exhibit 5, claimed that the Original Note is in their possession after JP MORGAN CHASE and XXXX XXXX claimed they lost the Note. 
JP MORGAN CHASE fabricated Lost Note Affidavit is dated XX/XX/XXXX.

Under FDIC regulations : DOCUMENTATION AS EVIDENCE.In any action involving a consumer, any documentation required by this section to be given to the consumer which indicates that an electronic fund transfer was made to another person shall be admissible as evidence of such transfer and shall constitute prima facie proof that such transfer was made. https : //www.fdic.gov/XXXX JP MORGAN CHASE did not provide documentation to the name on account they transferred the funds to and how much. 

XXXX XXXX was sued for opening accounts without customers knowledge sets a precedent. 

They have demonstrated the lengths they will go to continue their unethical conduct. 

JP MORGAN CHASE repeatedly, willfully and intentionally violated my contractual rights and misuse of my personal information to fraudulently open accounts to borrow money without my knowledge or authorization. Violation of TILA.

I have been receiving harassing and threatening phone calls and voicemail messages are saved. 

JP MORGAN CHASE and their attorneys at XXXX XXXX AND XXXX acts were willful, malicious and oppressive and were undertaken with intent to defraud. They engaged in conduct so despicable as to justify exemplary monetary penalties.

I went directly to JP Morgan Chase branch located on XXXX XXXX XXXX. The personal banker advised she could not access the account because the account was frozen. She called in to the customer service/fraud department and they advised the account was frozen for review and no information could be provided to me since it was not my account and I was not a client of theirs ( I expressed that I was a credit card holder with the bank but that did not matter ). I was instructed to get in contact with my bank to request a wire recall.

I then went to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   and processed the wire recall on XX/XX/XXXX inside of the branch. Since then I have heard nothing unless I call in to check the status. I have called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who states they have sent over multiple wire recalls and have only received one response stating the account is being reviewed. XXXX XXXX is telling me to contact Chase to see if I can get it resolved faster because there is nothing they can do until Chase responds. I call Chase and no one will help me because I am not a client/ account holder and advises me to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX .

Monday was my last and final time calling XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX after this cycle of calls, back and forth, and ultimately being told this could take 6-12 months to be resolved. I previously worked in the fraud department with a local bank and this time frame is unacceptable.

I am prepared to escalate this to the attorney general and above if this is not resolved. Fraud is never fun for any of the parties or institutions involved but I am not receiving any resolution. Being told to call back in a week or 2, to wait 6-12 months, requesting multiple wire recalls is ridiculous. I am prepared to end all banking relationships with both institutions.

The banks have hindered me from renting selling my property and have disrupted my quality of life for the past 7-10 years.
The substantiated evidence and facts therein has been given to Chase aka the alleged owner and investor of said loan on multiple occasions. Chase stated to me for years that they are the owner of such a loan. I did not give none of the banks involved permission to use my Social Security nor my identity to obtain such a loan.
I do not have a credit history with   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  WaMu  nor with JPMorgan Chase as well mention.
I have communicated with multiple agencies to investigate this alleged mortgage and find that they credit agencies have removed this alleged loan from my history in full.
Several Years ago I and my husband have filled this same complaint with the CFPB and no results so far this is why I and my husband are requesting that this be placed in the hands of the US Attorney General for legal due process.

CHASE LATEST RESPONSES As of XX/XX/XXXX , JPMorgan Chase mailed a letter requesting permission to release private information they should not be privy too nor where given permission to have to release this information to third party agencies. How can we allow this bank JPMorgan Chase to release such personal and private information that was never given to them by   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   and husband   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  .

This came about when my husband had secured a multimillion dollar investment deal with   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   The amount owed to him as of  XX/XX/XXXX  was {>= $1,000,000} USDA for this was an investment BOND for {>= $1,000,000} that was for his clothing company   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  .
 XX/XX/XXXX    XXXX   XXXX   attempted to trick us into a refinance for {$510000.00} once the good faith estimate was done the deal began to change to a basic refinance to a arm balloon deal and the offer for {$510000.00} was changed to {$460000.00} by   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  .
Thereafter we decided not to do a refinance and just keep the loan we had  with EMC Mortgage T X. So on XX/XX/XXXX  I and my husband signed the right to cancel document only and placed a copy in the mail as well faxed and delivered a copy of the RTC or rescission documents stating that we had 72 hours to cancel and we did within 24 hours.
  XXXX   XXXX   of   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   d.b.a   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   sent confirmation letter that the right to cancel was excepted on  XX/XX/XXXX , as well that there was not hard hits on our credit reports. For at the time i and my husband was very concerned because we where rebuilding our credit scores which fell below   XXXX    ratings. We received the letter on thereafter  XX/XX/XXXX  with this date and it was mailed USPS metered mail with tracking and we kept both the letter and the envelope.
I continued paying EMC mortgage until  XX/XX/XXXX  received the payoff notice paid in full. As of  XXXX   XX/XX/XXXX  to XX/XX/XXXX WaMu began calling and harassing my family friends in other states and as well my neighbors stating that we did n't pay our bills and a list of other lies which did and was embarrassing at the time. WaMu claimed that they where the owner of the note or mortgage rather they never placed a mortgage assignment on the property, nor was there any written notice that they acquired servicing rights or note! they also claimed that they the investor was WMMCO located in North Carolina but we spoke with and received a letter via email that this was a fraud discovered by the FTC in  XX/XX/XXXX / XX/XX/XXXX . They later then changed the alleged Investor information to a WMBAS  XX/XX/XXXX .
JPMC [ JpMorgan ] Chase also began stating that they owned the mortgage note and stated on three occasions that they acquired it from WaMu as of  XX/XX/XXXX . The first time they stated this they claimed they acquired it  XX/XX/XXXX  Then another statement or letter claimed they JPMC acquired the note on XX/XX/XXXX  and another claim for acquisition by JPMC was for  XX/XX/XXXX  sent to me on  XX/XX/XXXX . Three different dates which are false.
We my husband and i noticed that there where some fraudulent issues being reported, JPMC claimed that i was paying them through EMC mortgage as of  XX/XX/XXXX . This is impossible because I was sending my payments to EMC mortgage Co located in Texas. No relations to JPMC until EMC was acquired as of  XX/XX/XXXX  by JPMC.
My husband received notice that a lien was placed upon his name and the house that was not in his name but my name as of  XX/XX/XXXX  for a JPMC credit card whom JPMC removed the lien XX/XX/XXXX . Very strange.
 XX/XX/XXXX    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   former employee of   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    WaMu and now currently employed by JPMC place a Mortgage Assignment on my property without notice as well on XX/XX/XXXX  I was at the local  XX/XX/XXXX  County Registrar office to record a document but never saw the Mortgage Assignment as I learned that upon doing a securitization analysis and a   XXXX    report. There are also over 10 banks breaking chain of title and more please see the   XXXX   report and the securitization analysis.
 XX/XX/XXXX  myself and my husband filed a claim against   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   '' CEO and Chair of JPMC for fraud forgery identity theft and included was the missing USDA Bond fo  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   in the amount of $   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   USDA.
The case was later dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.
All this information concerning my home i.e. mortgage assignment is false we are requesting permission to file a law suite against JPMC WaMu and other banks involved. Please provide us such passage to do so. For they are claiming that we owe them JPMC {$500000.00} as well they have extorted me for more than {$140000.00}. Pain and suffering and more. JPMorgan Chase Co Bank NA and such the like of a mortgage company has yet to provide any proof of this alleged mortgage assignment nor of any real living agreement or transfer of funds for said loan. No invoice or bank check for proof of funding just a forged note.
STEPS TAKEN Multiple attempts for proof of NOTE MORTGAGE AND PAYMENT INFORMATION has been requested by   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   and husband   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   with payoff and discharged options. This information was sent to the CEO Chairman/ CFO and their payoff departments as well their legal representative   XXXX   XXXX   whom writes a blog for the CFPB. Rather ignored by all parties [ the banks ] involved. Attached are all documents provided by the   XXXX    or   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   and husband   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   as discharged charge off and payoff information that is deemed legal, without recourse."

This has badly damaged our credit. 
Since XX/XX/XXXX, my wife and I have had XXXX mortgages with Chase and we opened the home equity line of credit in XX/XX/XXXX. Prior to XX/XX/XXXX, we have never missed a payment and certainly did not intentionally miss the one reported. 
To ensure we do n't miss payments, we have been making payments automatically for years. The auto amount we had set for the home equity line was {$700.00} ( the minimum was about {$550.00} ). We do n't review mail on a timely basis - we do n't need to since our bills are paid automatically. 
XX/XX/XXXX, we received a notice that the line of credit terms would be changing XX/XX/XXXX and the amount would be increasing based on estimation. Chase reps have told us that there were other letters, the latest about 3 months in advance, but we did not receive it. We would have expected even more recent notices. 
Chase continued to accept our regular {$700.00} payment in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. They did not notify us that additional amounts were owed or that we were late and in jeopardy of collection efforts. They kept taking our {$700.00} payment and life continued as normal. 
In the meantime, my wife 's mother fell XXXX ill, was admitted to the hospital on XX/XX/XXXX and stayed for a month. So it was n't until XX/XX/XXXX that my wife noticed during a check of our credit report ( that we have been trying so hard to improve ), that the payment amount on our home equity line was greater than our auto payment amount. 
My wife then went online to make the payment change ; however, Chase.com did n't allow the auto payment amount to be changed, so she cancelled the auto payment and opened a new account. The account had to be verified, taking a few more days, and then when she attempted to make the payment, she was unable to pay the outstanding balance. Instead, we were required to pay the outstanding balance plus the next payment that was n't due for about 20 some days, which made for an unaffordable $ XXXX+ payment. 
Yet, after canceling the auto payment in XX/XX/XXXX, it still went through that month - unexpectedly, which could have caused financial problems if we had mailed the payment, because it took a call to Chase to cancel the auto payments. 
It was during that call to Chase on XX/XX/XXXX that payment was made. The call was made after receiving our first notice from Chase. The document was dated XX/XX/XXXX and we received it over the XXXX holiday. This was our first notification the payment was late, but even then there was no warning or mention that you would be reporting us to the credit bureaus. 
We did not find out that Chase had given us a negative report to the credit bureaus until XX/XX/XXXX, when we checked our credit report. Because of this, our credit rating dropped more than XXXX points! And because of this, we may lose our home because the payments are too high for us to afford ( and they are not a fixed amount so we can no longer pay automatically ). This is unfair. 
When I disputed the incident with Chase 's branch manager in XXXX, KY, your personnel claimed that they called us, but the telephone numbers they used were old numbers and no longer in use. 
Granted, we were late. But I submitted that it was not entirely our fault and I asked them to please forgive this error and remove the late payment report so that we may refinance our home at a competitive rate."

The following will provide the information I have reported to the XXXX CEOs of Chase Bank. I am assuming that they have received the e-mails, although they have not responded. The content of the e-mails regarding this most recent complaint is as follows : To XXXX CC XXXX Message body Dear Sirs : I had written to both of you on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and, once again, XXXX XXXX, XXXX explaining the various complaints and issues I have been experiencing with Chase Credit Card Services. I have filed two complaints against Chase with the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and now am going to write for a third time to the Bureau to register another new complaint. 
I check my Chase on-line statement twice a day. When I checked it this morning, the balance was approximately {$320.00} which was correct ; however, when I checked it this evening it was {$410.00}. I did not see any new charges posted to the account that would have caused the additional amount to be added ; therefore, I immediately called Customer Service and was told that a charge had re-posted to the account which had been a fraudulent charge posted by XXXX to my account ending in XXXX. At that time, the Fraud/Security Department had advised me that they would close that account and send me a new credit card with different numbers, which they did. I was also advised that I was not responsible for that charge. I had not only contacted Chase about the fraudulent charge but also XXXX ( which they never responded ) and also the BBB to report the fraudulent activity. I do not know how XXXX got my credit card number but I am adamant about never using their services and therefore not responsible for this charge. Why would this charge be re-posted to my account without notifying me? If it was a fraudulent charge then, it is surely still a fraudulent charge now and I am going to dispute it once again. 
I have been so upset because I have been working with your Corporate team to try to get so many issues resolved and now I feel that Chase has compromised my identity, etc. They are authorizing changes to my account that I never made. I have been asking that they listen to the numerous calls and find out that it was not me that reported a fraudulent charge on XXXX XXXX or told them that I lost my credit card. Over the weekend, I received another new card with new numbers which I knew nothing about and was told that they closed my account ending in XXXX because of either a fraudulent charge or a lost card, none of which I was ever aware of. I am considering filing a complaint in small claims court against Chase for all of the stress and expended time and energy I have had to deal with over their numerous mistakes. 
I will continue to write to both of you until I hear from someone in your office or, in the alternative, until my situation is resolved permanently.

The creditor is JPMCB JP Morgan chase auto loan # XXXX which they have inaccurately and cavalierly reported to the credit bureaus XXXX  and XXXX  a 30 day late payment on this lease on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and even now in XX/XX/XXXX - the lease is paid in full and now complete. To make matters worse, I even have a new lease with them, but they are still, as of today, reflecting my LEASE payment past due and combination of their ERRORS and gross mishandling of my account is costing me the ability to purchase a home that I am well qualified for to buy. The lender is telling me my credit score is XXXX and XXXX ; 100 % from Chase reporting these inaccuracies. 

As an incredibly busy XXXX XXXX XXXX working long hours in the XXXX  and XXXX  at truly any hour of the day or night, I need to make my payments easy and fast. I downloaded the Chase app on my phone to be able to pay my monthly lease online. What is beyond frustrating is that I have a Chase Sapphire Reward card, which connected to this app and I was able to pay every month on time without any late payments. However, due to their inadequate system, my Chase lease would only show the balance on the app, however not allow me to pay online. I called them on SEVERAL OCCASIONS only to get the run around. At one point the representative told me that there was nothing that they could do and that I was just going to have to deal with calling every month and do it over the phone. I tried to explain to them that this was not something I could do every single month and that I needed a more efficient way of paying, however they never wanted to help or try make the payment process easier for me. To make matters even worse is that I begged them to sign me up for auto-pay on the phone. I was told repeatedly after several phone calls that I needed to sign up online. This was after I had told them nearly a THOUSAND times that my account was not syncing up online and that was the initial problem! I was finally able to get a representative to take my routing number and checking account number after calling them over and over again. I was told that I was enrolled in autopay until the next month, when I received an alert on XXXX XXXX saying that my credit score had dropped. When I looked, I saw that it was Chase! I couldn't believe that audacity! I called them immediately and I was told that they had no record of me signing up for autopay. This company does not value their customer or their word. Looking back, I should have never signed up for a another lease with them at the end of XXXX for a new car. Once this lease term ends, I will never be doing business with this company again. Sadly, I'm doing payments over the phone AGAIN with this new lease and have just given up with trying to do it online or through auto-pay. 

I am a XXXX/XXXX  working every single day XXXX  XXXX XXXX. This is the last thing I want to be dealing with right now. I am trying to move my family into a new home so I am able to quarantine alone in case I am XXXX  with XXXX  and XXXX XXXX to my family and because of Chase ruining my credit score, this has become an impossibility. I need a clear head as a XXXX  to deal with the current climate that we face in this pandemic and instead I have to waste even more time dealing with Chase 's careless mistake."

My wife noticed payments from her bank account and marked it as fraudulent, but we did not identify my credit card as the account until JPMorgan Chase began sending me notices of the balance. I immediately paid the JPMorgan Chase credit line balance. The credit line remained open for about another month, during which I used the credit line and subsequently paid the balance. For all the credit line balance in question, I paid well within the terms. Recently, JPMorgan Chase closed the account and reported me as delinquent in the payments form XXXX to XXXX ( although the balance was paid immediately and for a second time ). I contacted JPMorgan Chase to resolve the issue. JPMorgan Chase claimed the payments were never received because the payments were reversed. I disputed, saying for the payments to be reversed they must have originally been made. I can not go back in time for a second payment to be received, an impossibility. Further, when the balance for the reversed payments was reported to me in XXXX, I immediately paid. Therefore, under no legal or logical definition was I delinquent by my own action. Despite my dispute, JPMorgan Chase closed the account and reported the fully paid balance as delinquent. I believe this was done to intentional impact my credit score ( which was immediately lowered ), or at the least, JPMorgan Chase 's systems and processes are recklessly designed to negatively impact debtors."

That caused them to think that I was late on my payment which then caused them to contact me about it. I have always had my mortgage payment set up on a recurring auto draft from my checking account with XXXX XXXX and therefore am never late. I informed them I hadn't changed anything and wasn't late. Different customer service people continued calling me for several months and I continued stating the same thing and eventually one of them finally actually researched and found the mistake which was in fact that Chase had misapplied my payment and it was an internal error and opened a research request to have it fixed. However, they continued to call me and I would have to repeatedly explain myself over and over and over. This went on for months. In the midst of all of this, my property taxes increased which caused my monthly payment to increase so I went onto my online banking auto draft and updated the amount. However, somehow, it also turned off the recurring auto payment without my knowledge. So in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I was in fact late due to my auto draft accidentally being turned off. But when Chase called to tell me I was late ( yet again ), I informed them that it was their mistake as I had been telling them and to research it and to pleaseeeee get it corrected. But it was actually late. But because of the headache that had been going on for months due their mistake ( which they have admitted and finally corrected ) - I ignored the calls. Then, I happened to be on my online banking account and discovered the issue and of course immediately turned auto draft back on and caught up on the 2 actual late payments. Again, all of this confusion occurred due to Chase 's initial mistake and their horrible customer service, lack of follow through on research requests to correct the misapplication of payment, etc. Now, I am trying to apply for a new mortgage and because of this chain of events - i am not able to get approved because of this late payments. I have opened ANOTHER Credit Amendment Dispute because the last one was denied but this time, I did actually get a helpful customer service representative on the phone who researched and said himself that it is clear that this not -- normal for me late occurrence was "" due to the initial misapplication of my payment back in XX/XX/XXXX at the fault of Chase - not me - which put everything out of wack. '' I need these late payments removed from my credit report under these unique circumstances. I have tried and tried and tried to get this resolved with Chase with no success and that is why I feel I have to come to you as a last resort. I even went in to a Chase Bank local office trying to get help since every time for months, different people would contact me and no one would ever know what was going on and I would have to educate yet another person that they misapplied the payment and sit on hold for forever while they learned about the case - but the local guy wasn't allowed to help me nor talk to a XXXX customer service rep on my behalf. I just wanted one dedicated individual that could help me get it fixed and they couldn't even deliver that level of customer service which is so disappointing and has been incredible frustrating. They also reported a {$17000.00} "" charge off '' on my credit report for a credit card that wasn't even in my name and was not mine! I am waiting for that to be corrected right now as well.

The "" transfer on '' date can only be the deliver on or before date. It can never be the "" send on '' date. This means a consumer wanting to transfer their money to an external savings account risks overdraft because the "" send on '' date is uncertain due to the random occurring weekends and holidays. Moreover, preventing customers from choosing the "" send on '' date for transfers biases Chase Checking account holders towards having savings accounts with Chase to eliminate the overdraft issue due to randomly occurring "" send on '' dates. 

I think this practice of not allowing customers to specify the dates of the month on or after their funds are sent may be an attempt by JP Morgan Chase NA to discourage external savings accounts and to boost overdraft fees. 

A consumer who selects a XXXX of the month transfer date on XX/XX/XXXX, for a recurring transfer will have the following next XXXX transfers. 

Send On Deliver ByXXXX/XXXX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXXIf that consumer gets paid on the XXXX of the month, she will have XXXX overdrafts if she does not have funds prior to getting paid to make the transfer. A Chase checking customer will have to select the transfer on date of the XXXX of the month to guarantee that none of the next XXXX transfers is sent on before the first of the month. Moreover, there is no guarantee that she will not have a transfer sent prior to the XXXX of the month after the first XXXX transactions leading to an overdraft. I believe that this might be a predatory way to set up transfers to maximize overdraft fees and scare JP Morgan Chase NA checking customers from using external savings accounts which likely offer better interest rates than Chase.

As I have learned, XXXX ( a subsidiary of XXXX ) collects and processes ACHs through Chase Bank. I do not have nor have I ever had any accounts with XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I notice an unauthorized debit for {$2000.00} from my XXXX account from "" XXXX PYMT '', which overdrew my checking account by about {$500.00}. I go down to a XXXX Branch in New Hampshire and tell an employee about this ( I think the branch manager ), and I am told in no uncertain terms that ACH transactions that are currently pending ca n't be disputed, and that there is absolutely nothing that can be done until it posts, which will occur the next business day. I was instructed to return the next day to file a dispute in writing ( the XXXX ) which I did. 

A week passed and I still did not see a refund applied to my XXXX account. I soon got a letter from XXXX, claiming that I really did authorize the transaction, and that my attempt to reverse the transaction was denied. Of course, I researched further, since this was plainly false. 

I received a copy of the discussion between XXXX and Chase bank ( attached ). XXXX opens the discussion by stating to Chase bank that XXXX customer ( me ) was claiming that this transaction for {$2000.00} was unauthorized. XXXX requested that Chase either return the money to them or to fax XXXX their evidence suggesting that I approved of the transaction. 

JP Morgan Chase replied by providing them with a paper containing numerous identification and trace numbers. What it did not contain was my signature or my voice authorization to debit the account. In fact, the second sentence of Chase 's reply to XXXX was this : "" Please notify J.P Morgan if the receiving client is disputing its validity and requesting a return. '' I reported XXXX to the CFPB, which is ongoing. 

Money was fraudulently debited from my account from XXXX XXXX to pay a car loan that is not in my name. Chase bank processes payments for XXXX, since they are n't an actual real bank. Thus, Chase made an unauthorized withdrawal from my checking account at the request of XXXX XXXX, and then credited that withdrawal to XXXX XXXX, who in turn credited it to whatever customers of theirs paid their car loan with it. 

I did not authorize Chase ( or anyone else ) to withdraw this money from my account. Chase responded to XXXX notification that the customer whose XXXX account they debited was alleging the transaction was unauthorized not by returning my money to XXXX, but with a "" proof of authorization '' that contains transaction numbers and descriptions, but no actual proof ( voice or signature or anything ) suggesting that I approved the transaction. The second sentence of this reply to XXXX request for Chase to reverse the unauthorized transaction actually suggests they are unaware that XXXX customer "" is disputing its validity and requesting a return. '' Despite Chase 's inability to provide any evidence that I authorized the withdrawal of {$2000.00} they made from my account, XXXX decided to rule that this transaction was authorized. When Chase bank received this dispute notification, they should have either provided evidence that I did in fact authorize the transaction ( which they ca n't, because I did n't ) or give the money back to XXXX so XXXX can return it to me. Instead, they sent XXXX not the money they should have returned, but the letter I attached describing the transaction, trace number, amount et cetera, and that did not appear to comprehend XXXX original claim that their customer was claiming that the transaction was UNAUTHORIZED. 

When Chase was notified by XXXX that XXXX customer from whom Chase debited {$2000.00} was claiming that the debit was UNAUTHORIZED, Chase should have returned the money to XXXX immediately based on Chase 's lack of evidence that I made this transaction."

In the attached, Chase requested list of fraudulent charges. The fraudulent charges started XX/XX/XXXX of {$450.00} to XXXX XXXX and all others after that. I was recovering from XXXX and faithfully making payments and not incurring any more debt. The fraudulent payments started one day after my payment on XX/XX/XXXX of {$220.00} on XX/XX/XXXX of {$2400.00} and made by phone. My payments were always on the web. Additional fraudulent payments were then made to circumvent Chases payment policy to exceed the credit limit up to {$12000.00}, {$5100.00} MORE THAN CREDIT LIMIT! 
Chase exacerbated the problem by not removing payments and charges. Then Chase charged off the card. I wanted to keep my card, continuing making payments on my debt. But now I dont have the {$5900.00} that was my portion. I am almost XXXX and dont have that money laying around. This problem was started by theft and fraud and view the {$5900.00} as fraud also. I had asked for return of cards but Chase isnt able to comply. What can be done? What are the options because my credit should be restored? Drastically discount the amounts due? 
Chase welcomed me to contact them to give fraudulent charges. Calling Chase is very difficult and it has been more productive and a better use of my time to correspond through CFPB. Instead of stressing consumers, would it be better for Chase to call the consumers when Chase is not so overwhelmed? My number is XXXX."

Chase Bank, who the holder of my auto loan, has reported that I have been in arrears on my auto loan. I repeatedly attempted to pay through their telephone system, even with their personnel. My bank has verified that the information I submitted was correct and there were always available funds ( document A ). Chase did not request the funds from my account until my third submittal, after I had paid the amount due in cash at a Chase branch ( document B ). 

Chase has concluded there was no bank error, therefore they will not request amending my credit report even though I repeatedly attempted to pay through their system, with their representatives, answering their questions as asked, was in immediate response to every communication, have double paid, and have been to various branches repeatedly to resolve this issue. 

This is a chronology of events : XX/XX/XXXX I made my XXXX payment of {$180.00} through their telephone system. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX I received a letter from Chase stating the payment was not received. I called twice on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with a Chase representative each time. I asked that the late fee be waived. I volunteered to pay my XXXX payment ( 10 days before the due date ) ( {$180.00} + {$180.00} ) to show I was not trying to shirk paying. I gave the information as requested from the representative. When I got off the phone I remember thinking, I guess he already has the routing number? He never asked me to give him all the numbers. But I assumed that since he was the representative, he was taking care of the payment. He knew what he was doing. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received another letter stating now my XXXX and XXXX payments had not been received which I opened XX/XX/XXXX in the evening. I had just received two separate letters from Chase regarding the updating of my information prior to this time. It is unfortunate this letter showed up a week or more later after the previous. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called at XXXX XXXX California time and spoke with someone in XXXX. I gave him all the information as requested, which he repeated back to me, three times to verify its accuracy. He said it would take up to five days to post. I told him I was going to call every day and check my bank account to make sure it had posted. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received an email alert from XXXX XXXX that my credit score had dropped 120 points. 
I called Chase. The representative recommended that I pull money from my ATM and walk it into a branch office. I did this, walking into Chase Bank at XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX. I paid {$380.00}. I spoke with an associate, whose name was XXXX, who recommended I speak with a manager, who was not in at that time. 

XX/XX/XXXX I went back to to the Chase branch in XXXX XXXX, twice, to speak with the manager. The second time, the manager was still not available and I spoke with another employee. She was very nice and could only verify everything I already knew. At this time, the third payment I had submitted had not been posted. She wanted me to have an auto-payment instituted, but I declined. Once there is a problem with the system, it is a nightmare to correct the error. My current situation being a case in point. She recommend that I go to my banking institution, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, get a letter verifying what my routing and account numbers were and that there funds available for the draw every time I attempted to make the payment. 

XX/XX/XXXX The payments I made with the representative, XX/XX/XXXX posted. I was now paid in advance through the end of XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from my credit union verifying the availability of funds for all dates requested. 
I walked the letter into a Chase branch on XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX. We faxed the request for inquiry. I believe she asked them to expedite the request. I believe I was told to check back on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX I walked into the Chase branch on XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX to find out whether there had been resolution. The man I spoke with called and spoke to someone. He said he was only able to ascertain, they were not finished with their inquiry and would need until the XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX I came home to find a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating Chase : ... confirmed your account reported correctly and does not need corrections Besides being vague whether this was that my account balance had been made current and was no longer in default or if this was about the inquiry, since I had spoken with their representative on the XXXX and was told the inquiry had not been completed and to wait until the XXXX, it seemed as if this was about the balance, not the inquiry. I will attach it separately. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called the XXXX number on the letter and spoke to a manager, XXXX. She told me the letter was about the inquiry. The bank had found no bank error so the negative report on my credit report would stay. The initial representative told me, the bank would not, as a COURTESY, remove the notice. I could not speak to someone in the review division regarding this. 

I drove to XXXX and spoke with a man at the XXXX XXXX XXXX branch about what I could do. He recommended that I come in the next day and speak with XXXX because I had initially spoke with her. 

XX/XX/XXXX I came in and spoke with XXXX. Because I repeatedly had come back to Chase to pay, they never had to come looking for me, she thought I should be able to appeal on the executive level. She would reach out to them and someone would get back to me in 24-48 business hours. This was a Friday. It would be Monday or Tuesday before I heard from someone. 

XX/XX/XXXX A representative of Chase Bank called me. I spoke with XXXX who facilitated a conference call between us and XXXX, a representative of the reviewing agency. I told them I thought the problem was in the second call I had made to attempt to pay. The representative had asked me for my account number and then whether there were XXXX before the number. He never asked for the full account number. I thought this was where the problem lay. I was told they would listen to the tape and that someone would get back to me within 24-48 hours. I asked that I receive a copy of the recordings that had been made. It was not possible but, I was told I could have the transcript of the events as they had them as they occurred. I have never received them. 

XX/XX/XXXX The 48 hour mark passed. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX and left a voicemail because no one had called me. She returned my call and said she would look into it and have someone call me back. No one called. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX, twice and left voicemail messages. She never returned my calls. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX and left a voicemail. She never returned my call. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX and left a voicemail. She never returned my call. 

XX/XX/XXXX I came into XXXX and spoke to XXXX. No one was responding to my phone calls. I had been told I would have a response in 24-48 hours. She called someone, ascertained a manager would be there the next day XX/XX/XXXX and that the recording in question would be reviewed and she would have an answer on Monday. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called me. The tape had been listened to. She had heard it. That which was in question was the exchange between their representative and myself. He had asked me for my account number When anyone asks me for my account number at my credit union I tell then XXXX. This is what I told him. He asked where there any XXXX before it. I said yes, there were XXXX XXXX. He never asked me to give him the entire account number. The representative in XXXX asked me to repeat the routing number and the full account number from the colon, three times. This representative never asked me for this : Because he never asked me to verify all the numbers at the bottom of my check, Because I didnt ask him, dont you want me to give you all the numbers at the bottom with the routing number? 
Because he did not verify the accuracy of the information I gave him, Because I only answered his questions as he asked them of me, the information was entered incorrectly and without notification until after the due date, my account became over 30 days late. 

For 29 months this account was paid on time. This is the only time I have ever been considered late, even though I was repeatedly attempting to pay through Chases system. I have never had a late payment on my credit score, and I am XXXX years old. 

I have been assiduously nurturing my credit score. 

My son and I lost our home in the XXXX XXXX in XXXX. No one was home to evacuate. We lost everything. 

I have been working on rebuilding our home for the past five years. It has been an extremely difficult process. The insurance was difficult. The mortgage holder was difficult. The general contractor I had been required to hire before the plans were finished, was more than {$200000.00} over bid after all the financial numbers had been secured. I fired him and am now my own XXXX XXXX. I have been working very hard to bring the construction costs down and had gotten them to an almost manageable amount. Because no one would give me a construction loan or a HELOC on an unfinished home, I have had a rough time finding a lender to finance the amount I need to finish construction. 

I finally found a lender. I was getting ready to hand in all of our paperwork the beginning of XXXX. Now because of this miscommunication, this penalty is not just my credit score number but my ability to be able to get the money I need to finish rebuilding our home. Also, since this process began, the interest rate I was originally offered will not be valid because interest rates have risen. 

It never was or has ever been my intention for these payments become late and show up on my credit score. The only reason I tried to use the phone system was that because of other exigencies, I did not mail the payment in time. It is advertised that one can make a payment over the phone. I was afraid I would be a day or two late. I had no idea it would become what it has become and jeopardize what I have been working toward for the past five years.

By the time I run out of funds, I will have invested {$530000.00} into the rebuilding of my home. Why would I do anything to jeopardize our lives like this?

I have attached supporting documents from my credit union, the cash payment receipt, the Chase letter dated XX/XX/XXXX and phone records from XX/XX/XXXX through mid-day of XX/XX/XXXX ; calls to XXXX XXXX XXXX/Chase are highlighted. I do not have records from this month 's statement. 

Thank you for your help, and I pray you can help me.

I wanted to know if the same rule applied for business credit cards. The woman representative who answered my call, I cant remeber her name, said she was not familiar with that rule and shes never heard of it before, BUT she said, she has seen it online but shes not familiar with it. I said, so since youre not familiar with the 5/24 rule and you work in the business credit dept, it doesnt apply? She said, no, it doesnt. Based on Chases business credit card reps admonition whose job is to answer cardholders questions and potential card holders questions to the best of her ability, a decision was made to apply for their XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card and I was immediately declined. If I was given correct information from their business credit card rep, I would have NEVER applied for their card when I have opened more than 5 new accounts within the past two years. The decision to apply for Chases credit card was not wholly based on me. The decision was based on INCORRECT information received from a paid employee, who I assumed, was trained to furnish cardholders and non-cardholders with correct answers to their inquiries. Once I was declined, I called and spoke to another Chase representative. I asked WHY I was declined, she looked up my application and said I was DECLINED because I have opened 5 NEW ACCOUNTS within 2 years! I asked to speak to a supervisor to inform them of my experience with the previous rep who gave me false information that was used, trusting that it was correct, to apply for their business credit card. I waited on the phone for over ten minutes to speak with a supervisor and no one came back to the phone. I called again, at approximately XXXX, XXXX XXXX Chase Business Credit card answered my call. His customer service was not less than deplorable! He spoke to me in a condescending tone, lecturing and adding more aggravation to the issue. I asked to speak this his supervisor. XXXX did not immediately transfer me to his superior without adding more insult to injury. Supervisor XXXX came on the phone. His attitude and customer services was almost as bad as XXXX. Overall, I did not get the help I sought. I called Chase to ask that the credit inquiry be deleted from my consumer report, seeing that I was given incorrect information from one of their representatives. The incorrect information was used to help in the decision to apply for credit that I was was denied. If furnished with the correct information I would not have applied for their card. Now, there is a inquiry on my consumer report, without being offered credit. 

If a credit card company places an inquiry on your report and doesnt offer credit, according to : 15 U.S. Code 1681b- Permissible purposes of consumer reports ( c ) ( 1 ) A consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report relating to any consumer pursuant to subparagraph ( A ) or ( C ) of subsection ( a ) ( 3 ) in connection with any credit or insurance transaction that is not initiated by the consumer only if- ( B ) ( i ) the transaction consists of a FIRM OFFER OF CREDIT ....

They say they didnt get any return mail but that doesnt mean anything. Ive been working for over 20 years in XXXX and Ive seen payments that were supposedly mailed out. Yes, the payment was actually mailed out when they told us and showed up months later. No one knows what happens once mail leaves our hands. Plus, we all seen what some postal workers do with mail they need to deliver. Im not saying that they didn't mail out a letter but just because there was no return doesnt mean I received it. Mail gets coded wrong all the time by the post office and ends up some where else. You would think people would put the wrong mail right back in the mail to be delivered correctly but this doesnt happen all the time. Mail also gets stuck in postal machines in the post office. There is many things that can happen. Also, why didnt they leave a voice message? I would had called back for this is my credit we are talking about. Also, for Chase to tell me it was up to the customer to call back every 12 months to continue the program is not true. Ive always received phone calls from Chase asking if I wanted to continue. 
Ive paid this account in full after trying to talk to them. 
I need Chase to be fair and take things into consideration. I need that late payment taken off my reports."

After talking with them on 3 occasions since Saturday XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, they acknowledge fault of this issue but say they 're unable to help me. 

XXXX - I configured online bill pay at Chase to send 60 payments to the car finance company, the first of which to go out on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and reoccur on the XXXX of each month. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - The final payment in a 60-payment series was sent. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - I checked the payoff amount with the finance company after the auto payment was sent and there was a reported {$0.00} discrepancy. Not wanting to drag out receipt of my title and eager to close my account, I sent a one-off payment of the {$0.00} balance. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received notification from the finance company that they rejected the {$0.00} payment due to the account being closed. They either waived the difference due to its small amount, or the website didnt yet take into account the final payment. Either way, not a big deal. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I also received notice from Chase via online secure message center that the {$0.00} payment was rejected and that We now need days to complete your payment and that if I set up a repeating payment theyll send it in time for the scheduled delivered-by date. 

Theyre making an assumption here that because XXXX rejected the electronic payment, future payments must be made by paper check. This is of no consequence to me, however, since the final payment already went out. But it turns out that it is my problem XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX sends a 61st payment out. 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I contact Chase to find out why this happened and get bounced between 4 different departments. Im told its a paper check that went out, which means I would be able to put a stop on it. But then Chase says they cant do that because the finance company already accepted the payment and they couldnt reverse the debit. How could they have accepted a paper check in 1 day? How is a payment both electronic and a paper check? 

XXXX/XXXX/XXXX After some back and forth with Chases online research department, they say it was, in fact, an electronic transmission of the funds. Even if it was my mistake that caused a 61st payment to go out, they had no reason or right to change the day that was going to happen. I could have seen the payment scheduled online in time and canceled it before it went out. At the very least, instead of changing when my payment was going to go out, they could have just kept it at as a notification that I should review the payment method and leave it to me to make that decision. They agree with me that they were wrong, but then say they cant do anything about it. 

In the meantime, the finance company has my money in limbo for 7-10 days until they return the payment. Im like most Americans living paycheck to paycheck and have to deplete my minimal savings and put groceries on a credit card so my family can eat.
TL ; DR Chase cant count to 60, makes assumptions they shouldnt, changes to send dates of payments they shouldnt be allowed to, and then cant support or justify the assumptions and decisions they made."

My payments of {$1200.00} have a grace period of the 15th of the month. I sometimes pay just after the 15th because of my pay period and accept the late fee of {$52.00}. I have always paid within the month and have never paid after the month end ( XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX ). My account is current ( always has been ) and "" Paid as Agreed '' status. 

For my XX/XX/2019 payment, I submitted my payment of {$1200.00} ( late fee included ) online on XX/XX/2019. I received a confirmation email ( attached ). It was to be withdrawn from my Chase Checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/2019 the payment had not been deducted from my checking account, so I contacted XXXX, who told me my Loan had been purchased and was being transferred to Chase Home Mortgage. The transfer started on XX/XX/XXXX and I would be able to access my account information on the Chase website starting XX/XX/XXXX. My payment, since it was paid electronically would eventually be withdrawn from my checking account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I logged into the Chase website to view my transferred account Account # XXXX and it indicated I was "" Past Due '' for my XX/XX/2019 payment. I immediately contacted Chase Home Mortgage Customer Service and explained the situation, she said "" Don't worry '' the transfers have a 60 day grace period and you will not be reported late. She opened a case to locate the "" Missing Payment. '' I told her I had the email confirmation and it was submitted electronically. She said it will eventually show up. I said when I pay my XX/XX/2019 payment, will they post it to XXXX or XXXX, she said XXXX. I felt somewhat relieved by the 60 day transfer grace period and that, at least, I would not be reported 30 Days Late. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a credit monitoring alert to my phone with a message that "" Derogatory '' information on you Mortgage Account has been updated in you credit bureau. I logged in and sure enough, XXXX, XXXX is reporting me 30 Days Late for my XX/XX/2019 payment. I was livid!!! 

I should not be reported 30 Days Late as I was not 30 Days Late, the mortgage transfer has my payment in a black hole somewhere. I should no be penalized with a derogatory mark on my credit bureau for a system issue in the mortgage transfer to Chase. This is very unfair and somewhat of a deceptive practice. Moreover, this is inaccurate record keeping by a financial institution. 

I am requesting this 30 Days Late be removed from all three of the credit bureaus ( XXXX XXXX an XXXX ) and updated to reflect "" Paying as Agreed. '' I am beyond frustrated with this situation and the customer service from XXXX, XXXX. 

Any help is appreciated! 
Thank You, XXXX XXXX XXXX"

The currently pending claims involve fraudulent charges made on my credit card in a foreign country. The pending claims provide detailed information regarding Chase Banks intentional evasiveness, delay tactics, and refusal to resolve my matter. 

Shortly after the above-mentioned claims were filed with the CFPB, Chase Bank engaged in retaliatory behavior against me. With at least the knowledge of the claim filed by the California Department of Business Oversight ( CDBO ) ( which was submitted on XX/XX/2019 ), and possibly also the knowledge of the claim I filed on XX/XX/2019, Chase Bank first closed the matter that was the basis for the claims ( despite their being open claims with the CFPB ), and then restricted my online access to my account. 

Chase Bank informed me that it was closing my matter in a letter dated XX/XX/2019 just two days after I submitted my CFPB complaint, and 12 days after the CDBO submitted a complaint on my behalf. The XX/XX/XXXX letter contained material misstatements regarding which charges I am disputing. Chase Bank then restricted online access to my bank account, disabling certain features and preventing me from using the over 300,000 points Ive accumulated as a Chase Bank customer. In multiple instances, when I tried to access my online account, a prompt stated that my email address had been changed to XXXX and that access was forbidden. 

I believe Chase Bank closed my matter and restricted access to my account because of the claims the CDBO and I filed with the CFPB. Chase Bank is aware of the amounts I owe, and that those amounts are significant to me. Chase Bank is also aware that the issues involved in the recently closed matter are the same issues that form the basis for the claims filed with the CFPB. 

Chase Bank unrestricted access to my account after my attorney placed two unanswered calls and two unanswered emails to the Chase Executive Fraud Department, as well as one unanswered call to the Chase Fraud Department. Chase Bank returned my attorneys calls, on XX/XX/2019. My attorney spent 30 minutes speaking with the Fraud Department, 10 minutes on hold, and 20 minutes speaking with a representative in the Customer Service Department. The Chase Fraud Department referred my attorney to the Customer Service Department because the Fraud Department only deals with fraud.

During my attorneys call with the Chase Fraud Department, the Chase Bank agent ( XXXX XXXX ) told my attorney that if he wanted access to the audio recordings referenced in Chase Banks XX/XX/2019 letter to me ( written by XXXX XXXX ) he would need to subpoena that information. The letter specifically mentioned that certain audio recordings were germane to my matter being closed and the fraudulent charges being upheld. The audio recordings mentioned in the XX/XX/2019 letter had never previously been mentioned over the course of the eight months Ive been disputing the charges. 

After being referred by the Fraud Department to the Customer Service Department, the Customer Service Department informed my attorney that he would again need to include me on a call to verify that my attorney is who he says he is ; however, on multiple occasions, I had already provided Chase Bank with confirmation that my attorney represents me, both orally and in writing. Whats more, the Fraud Department had just spoken about my matter at length with my attorney right before connecting my attorney to the Customer Service Department. 

Both the Fraud Department and the Customer Service Department told my attorney that a security hold had been placed on my online account. The Customer Service Department revealed that security holds are put in place when there has been a suspected security breach. There was no suspected security breach. The Customer Service Department said that the security hold would be in place until I received a new card for the account on which the fraudulent charges had been made but I received that new card ( and a new account number ) over 8 months ago, and Chase Bank knew this. 

Shortly after my attorney ended the call with the Chase Bank Customer Service Department, my attorney received a call from the Chase Executive Fraud Department. The Executive Fraud Department again confirmed that there was a security hold on my account, and that they would need to reach out to the Security Department to determine why the hold was in place. They told my attorney they would call him back when the Executive Fraud Department heard from the Security Department this was yet another delay tactic consistent with the pattern of behavior complained of in the previously filed CFPB complaints. 

The Executive Department also again refused to send my attorney the audio recordings that formed the basis for Chase Bank upholding the fraudulent charges to my account. The Executive Fraud Department did, however, at my attorneys forceful request, agree to send him a typed summary of the recordings. The Executive Department iterated that if my attorney wanted the actual audio recordings, he would need to send a subpoena request to their National Subpoena Processing Department. This is still another example of the  kind of institutionally embedded delay tactics and clandestine coercion used by Chase Bank to prevent opposition to its decisions. 

Chase Bank recorded all of my phone conversations with its agents, not for customer service purposes, but to now egregiously misrepresent those conversations as evidence for upholding the fraudulent charges. Chase Bank is withholding those audio recordings to prevent me from defending my claims. Apparently Chase Bank has built into its business model various ramparts of time-consuming and burdensome steps that prevent its clients from accessing mutual information related to its clients claims against the bank. 

Later, and still on XX/XX/2019, my attorney and I called Chase Bank to, once again, verify my attorneys identity ; we were then able to confirm that the bank had, evidently within the past few hours, removed the online restrictions on my account. The Executive Fraud Department did not contact me nor did they contact my attorney to mention that the restrictions were lifted. This tends to show the security hold was retaliatory. 

In the letter Chase Bank sent me on XX/XX/2019, Chase Bank demanded that I pay the amounts that form the basis for the claims filed with the CFPB. I maintain that I do not owe the amounts Chase Bank asserts I owe because those charges were fraudulent, and the claims with the CFPB have not been resolved. 

I believe Chase Bank retaliated against me to discourage me from continuing to dispute the charges and to punish me for continuing to object to their egregious institutional practices and conduct ( e.g., their delay tactics ) related to those charges."

Having always relied on chase and rarely having had any such problems, as I was sure I was a good customer who paid his bills and and did as any other, this came as quite a shock but I did not think much of it. It was only when I soon called in to inquire about the declined charge that my relationship with chase was suddenly torn into pieces and thrown away. It seemed as if in a heartbeat I went from a good customer to a customer which they care nothing about and are willing to throw out and forget about. I was told over that phone call, vaguely, that for reasons they can not disclose and will not disclose my accounts had all been shutdown, all my personal credit cards, bank accounts, and safety deposit box has been immediately and permanently shutdown! This unfortunate series of events caught me in a stage of shock where I had no clue what to do. All of a sudden it seemed as if a big part of my life revolved around chase and it was now all gone for reasons I did not even know or to this day will never know. I was told that I will get a letter to inform me about this and thinking that it will hopefully clarify what happened I was wrong. All the letter mentioned that I was no longer a customer chase wanted to do business with and therefore they abruptly shutdown all my accounts. Not only that but they went so far as to shutdown my mothers accounts as well which I found completely rude, unprofessional, and uncalled for. I always believed I was a good customer with chase who paid promptly and was risk averse if anything and I would at least like to know what I did wrong so I can avoid doing so with other banks in the future although I truly do hope to rebuild my relationship with chase if my accounts do get reinstated. These events have caused my credit score to drop and less attractive to other banks as it now shows my accounts were closed by the issuer and also ruined my average age of credits along with other things."

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- CONSUMER COMPLAINT SUBJECT : Chase Bank Marketing Harassment My complaint concerns Chase Bank. I am not a Chase Bank customer, NOR will I ever become a Chase Bank customer. However, I am very frustrated by Chase 's aggressive marketing tactics. I would describe it as "" Marketing Harassment ''. 

Chase is relentless in sending postal mail solicitations. Their tactic appears to be to flood your mail box with these solicitations to beat the consumer into submission to open an account so that the consumer will finally receive relief from these mail outs. I recall that at one time the frequency I was receiving these solicitations was about once per week. Over the course of a year this really adds up. It is also an extreme waste of natural resources, thereby being environmentally detrimental due to what has to thousands of tons of paper that they likely consumer annually for their overall mail solicitations across the country. Additionally, it certainly wastes my time in having to shred this "" junk mail '', which is very frustrating. 

It took me having to make numerous phone calls over a three year period to finally get them to stop mailing me solicitations to my home address as well as my P.O. Box. These postal solicitations were addressed directly to me by my name. I believe they finally ceased doing this in late XXXX or early XXXX. 

However, this year they started mailing me these solicitations once more, though they are now addressed to "" Our Neighbor '' at both my street address and my P.O. Box. 

I contacted Chase customer service this evening to request these mail solicitations be stopped. However, based on past experience I do not trust that Chase will do so. I am also equally concerned that if in fact they do stop sending this current batch of solicitations, that some time in the future they will simply start up again by addressing them instead to "" Current Resident ''.

One question that most consumers who have experienced a similar excessively high volume of direct mail solicitations might ask is "" How many times and over how many years must a consumer fail to respond to a financial institution 's direct mail solicitations before the financial institution finally gets the hint that the consumer has no desire to do business with them? 

I am simply tired of Chase 's marketing harassment, and I desperately want it to stop once and for all. Therefore, I am seeking your assistance to make sure this will happen. 

Thank you for your assistance!"

Instead JP Morgan Chase reversed the car insurance payment and the life insurance payment that I saw already posted on my account to show they came after to then justify charging me {$34.00} three times, They returned the XXXX amount and the life insurance amounts but paid the 2nd amount of XXXX XXXX XXXX posted in error. The second amount was paid to XXXX even though there was a huge negative amount of $ XXXX. I was then charged the third amount of {$34.00} for a total of {$100.00}. I contacted both the car insurance and life insurance companies to verify the dates they posted those automatic payments and they were done on the dates I stated above ( I have the documentation to prove such from both organizations ). I check my account after I make any payments and after I know payments are scheduled to come out, so I am very much on top of my balances. Chase is fraudulently charging these insufficient funds fees to customers because they count on most people not checking their balances regularly. I want those charges removed. I think a class action lawsuit should be made by the banking organization that monitors banks who commit fraud."

I thought because I had paid my balance in full on the website it included my actual full balance due, including any interest that I had accrued to date.

There was interest charged in addition to what was posted as my balance on the website at the time I paid. I had no viability to that interest at the time of payment on their platform. I accrued around {$12.00} of interest that I had no idea about. I was affected by XXXX and unable to check my mail due to potential exposure by touching mail.

I was not treated appropriately and subsequently transferred to like 3 different departments all claiming not to know what the other department does. I asked to escalate over the supervisor I was speaking with and was denied the opportunity to speak to management. I was denied the opportunity to file a direct dispute and was told I can only file disputes with the CRA 's. That is not a direct dispute but an indirect dispute. I wanted to give my lender the opportunity to review what I was telling them was an error. Everyone I spoke to kept repeating how sorry they were and how they understood why I was so upset after being reported negatively after just having paid a balance in full.One of the representatives even waived my interest accrued as a courtesy but said it still needed to be reported late which makes no sense to me. I was not reported to the CRA 's because of an upaid dept. I was reported to the CRA 's for interest which a general customer service representative had no problem waiving for me. I find this action to be predatory and in violation of the Comprehensive Credit Act ( CARES ACT ) and ( HEROS ACT HR6800 ) Section 110401. I had asked repeatedly for a manager and was declined escalation, I had asked for information on how to directly dispute their verbal review and was told I could not dispute it with them. That statement was inaccurate. I feel the company has an opportunity now to rectify the harm I have received."

They closed my account because according to them they couldnt prove who he was. When we asked them why they didnt just transfer the money to the bank that issued it if they werent going to give it to us, they told us that eventually the money would be sent to our house, but that could take months or even years. I think that this shows a huge lack of respect, and it is abusive behavior toward a couple of people who are only claiming whats theirs. We have a critical situation involving a XXXX child."

Each month for over a year, I have been charged at least XXXX to XXXX overdraft charges which adds up to over XXXX a month. We applied for the card and it was denied. They said I had poor credit and refused to give me a credit card or account up to XXXX that could cover any charges I might incur. I think this is discriminatory and unfair banking practices since I applied for a loan online with liberty bank and received an automatic loan for XXXX. Immediately! Yet my own bank which makes XXXX of dollars per year off of my checking acct refuses to give me a credit card limit up to XXXX to cover overdraft fees. I have been paying the fees yet they said my credit is poor.To me this is ridiculous practice. It does not make sense for me as a consumer to continue to pay the bank these outrageous fees on my acct and not be given any credit with the bank. They also say they have the right to determine which charges they will cover so I have had a cup of coffee of XXXX paid with their XXXX fee and yet a car payment of XXXX was refused. To me, this is also discriminatory. Why would they not pay a person 's car payment which is necessary for the persons work and go ahead and pay for the cup of coffee? To me it is all about how much money they can make off of my account. 
I have explained this to the bank manager, I have called their XXXX number to discuss the over use of their of the XXXX fee and their discriminatory practice, yet they refused to deal with a simple solution because "" I have poor credit. '' Yet they continue to rob my bank account with XXXX a month payments and their whim. Please investigate this policy and determine if there is anything I can do. I am just a middle class citizen who works long hours and am trying to survive."

In XXXX of XXXX my bookkeeper, who I had arrested this past year for embezzling, stopped paying my bills amongst many other nefarious activities. 
It took me almost 6 months to realize this and by that time was forced to close my account. 
I got set up on a payment plan and all was great for a year. 
I never received a statement of account or anything else other than a generic monthly "" Your payment is due '' notice. What Chase failed to alert me to in any way was that the original payment plan expires at a year ... So in XXXX of XXXX I went late, and in XXXX called after not seeing my payment being extracted out. Surprised to hear I was no longer in a payment plan I eagerly set up another. This was in affect for XXXX. What Chase failed to do was let me know that I was two payments behind or that I owed X amount of dollars to get current. No, I was just placed back on an auto-debit that extracted monies monthly ... ... ..35 days past their actual due date. 
So for the following year and a half I was marked late every month and no, I wasnt contacted alerted, no late payment notice, just the same generic "" Your payment is due '' notice. There wasn't even a way to mount my account online, it didn't exist ( At the time ) After seeing my FICO number continually decreasing I thought something must be up and I dug deeper. I actually was surprised that my personal credit could be affected by a business account to begin with. I thought that was horrible to tie a personal social security to a business and I never signed a Personal Guarantee. 
I started calling Chase because its the only thing that could be dragging me down, we finally spoke to XXXX XXXX who was able to see that for the past almost two years Chase, despite extracting the money through an ACH, had been taking it 35 days late and reporting me late. Every month. 
So I write this complaint to try and rectify the situation. XXXX said she could help but refused to. I have had my life ruined and there's no culpability from Chase, no help, no anything. I am damaged from them. 
Please help."

So we proceed and I give the person my information needed to access the account, they said a verification text will be coming to me and to repeat the verification code, sure enough I got the code and gave to them, things still sound good. Then after about 30min being on the phone, they gave me two confirmation numbers to use to reference this call and that my account is closed and card will no longer be active and will be sent another card within 10 business days. All fine and dandy, til I never heard back from chase after the 10 days, I actually called within 5 days to  check in. Sure enough the chase representative says there was no call regarding this activity and that my account was still active and card was still active. Right away I knew this was a fraudulent/scam call and they got into my account and transferred {$1200.00} using quickpay to XXXX. I never signed up for quickpay nor did any transactions ever with XXXX. So Chase 's claim department denied the claim and I'm at loss of {$1200.00} to someone I have no idea who it is.

If this is the case with all calls, then everyone would be a victim.

So i'm looking for help, my account is in the negative now because of this, many insufficient charge fees, etc. I've changed all pw, used virus scans, etc. and finally got back access to my online account and need this fraudulent transfer resolved.

After that I immediately called Chase and told them that I had spoken with a XXXX representative and I asked them to reverse the payment, they told me that it would not be a problem since I had already spoken with XXXX and the payment was still pending. I looked in my account and saw where the Chase representative had reversed the payment. Today, XX/XX/2018 I receive an email alert stating my account was overdrawn by {$130.00}. I called Chase and was told that they did not see where the payment had been reversed and that they did not see any record that I had spoken with anyone. Chase is famous for waiting for the money to go into an insufficient status before they start processing payments. I had about 8 items that I made transactions for from XXXX XXXX that did not show up until a week later although Chase had them paid on my transactions, later on in that week they have now been set to another date rather than the date originally done. These payments are taken out, and it appears that they have been paid the balance reflects this however I have been told that they don't actually process until the payment is made which inadvertently has the customer thinking that something has been paid when it actually wasn't and that the balance that is posted actually isn't correct. 
I also spoke with Representatives from XXXX who stated that they never received anything stating that the payment had been reversed and that the payment was not made. 

I do not believe that Chase should continue to take advantage of consumers and misleading them just to be able to charge them a daily {$35.00} insufficient fee which could add up to hundreds of dollars. 

I will make sure from this day forward that I have documentation and proof of Chase 's unfair practices since records seem to disappear from statements. I watched the transaction be removed on Sunday, here it is Tuesday, and there is nothing proving anything I have stated, not even a recorded call."

I was receiving bills in the mail paying my card in full. On XX/XX/XXXX my bill was {$2700.00}, so I send in a payment for {$3000.00} leaving a credit of {$230.00} on the account. After this date, I never received another bill from Chase so I assumed the account was paid in full. 

From XX/XX/XXXX2020 until XX/XX/XXXX2020 I never received a bill or notification from Chase to alert me that there was a balance due. They charged me late fees every month : {$28.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX20 ) and {$39.00} XXXX XXXX/XXXX/20, XXXX/XXXX/20, XXXX/XXXX/20, XX/XX/XXXX20 ). At the end of XXXX the bank finally reached out to me by phone so I went to my local branch to see what was happening. 

I was told that they were sending notices to the e-mail they had on file, but I had not used that e-mail since XXXX. They claim that I changed to paperless billing in XXXX, but I never did that. I also never received anything in the mail confirming that I changed to paperless billing. At the end of XXXX they cancelled the credit card, and took away my rewards balance which now totaled {$290.00}. The bank claimed that their internal collections department sent me letters on XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX which I also never received. 

Not only did I lose {$290.00} in rewards, and was charged late fees, but my credit score also went from XXXX  down to XXXX  because of this error. I am hoping that you can assist me in getting my credit score repaired and get my money back from the bank.

I submitted a dispute with XXXX  around XX/XX/XXXX because there is an account from 2016 I do not recognized ( RE : JPMCB ). There is no information on my profile as to who this company is. Did they provide XXXX  with a signed contract and an itemized bill? I have never received an itemized bill from this unknown company or any sort of documentation or letters from this company. I do not even know what the letters of the company stand for. XXXX  investigations often do not check for proper documentation. When an investigation is completed, it should be required that they should be providing the customer a copy of the documents that were provided as part of their investigation. 

The second complaint is the idea that XXXX  seems to retaliate when a complaint is submitted. I submitted a complaint because I do not recognize the company on file. They completed the investigation and my score went down XXXX points. This sounds like a practice to discourage people from submitting a request for an investigation. This should not be allow."

I will first reiterate that a local branch notice and showed me that the second money order was fake and voided it out so no one could cash it.So how can chase executives lie and say they cant tell if a money order is fake. Also your atms these days are select on what it accepts and can register if bills are fake or not, so how is it that a trusted serves of money order can not be detected. I am no lawyer cant afford one and I now feel pushed aside and lied to for a second time because they know so by going over my account information and then deciding to treat me like trash and sweeping me under the rug. I dont know your articles of law. All I know is i was shown by one of Chase branch workers that the money order was fake ( wich executives say they cant do ) and was shown how to tell when a money order fake ( wich executives say they cant do ). 
So What the point of stating legal chapters if they just lied to me and dont follow there own stipulations? I have kept names to myself. In hopes they treated me like they customer I thought I was at the branch. But soon as I get handed over to executives Im treated as if Im a bum holding a card board sign. 

P.s. again why lie about the help I already recieved in destiguising how to tell if a money order is fake? And why does a local branch offer more help than the executives?"

This was a surprise to me as I've sent him funds in the past via XXXX ( XXXX ) but nonetheless, I called Chase to reverse this transfer, as the funds had already left my checking account. Chase told me that they would process this claim with XXXX, and that usually these cases take about 10 days, at which point I should see the funds credited back into my account. About 2 weeks later I called Chase to follow up, as I had still not received my funds back, and the Chase representative told me that there's nothing else they can do on their end, as the case has already been referred to XXXX and is now sitting with them. I wrote down the case number and called XXXX, and the XXXX representative told me that they only provide the framework and system to Chase for use by their customers and are not liable for any of the funds. Furthermore, they told me that they can not provide any information as to the cases status because its confidential ( even though it's my own case and my funds ). They told me to contact Chase for more information as they are my financial institution and would have the answers. I called Chase back again and they told me yet again that the case has not been decided on yet by XXXX and that Chase is doing me a "" courtesy '' be filing a claim for reversal of these funds. I told Chase that as my fiduciary and financial institution it's their responsibility to ensure my funds are safe and are handled in a timely manner. The people at Chase felt they had done more than enough already and told me they could not do anything else at the moment. At this point, about 4 weeks have passed since my initial claim ( they originally told me it would be 10 days ). Now today, over 6 weeks since I initially called Chase, I contacted Chase yet again to ask where my funds were and they gave me the same response, that when the claim has been decided on they would credit the funds back to me. I explained to them that my funds are their responsibility and I asked that they credit my account temporarily for the {$140.00} until the decision has been made ( as they do with other claims regarding debit and credit card charges ). The lady told me they couldn't do that because the money is not their responsibility and is XXXX 's. I explained to them that XXXX is merely a service that Chase offers to its own customers, and that it's Chase 's obligation to ensure smooth operation for their customers. I explained that it is their duty to ensure customer funds are safe and secured and any money transfer services offered on their platform and app are their responsibility as well. The representative once again denied culpability and again told me that I'd have wait until this is sorted out on XXXX 's end. I advised her that if I'm not credited the {$140.00} within 24 hrs I will terminate my relationship with them and file a complaint to the CFPB, to which she did not respond at all. I then hung up."

When the account had a balance last year, I set up automatic payments for this account in order to decrease any chances of it going past due. Last XXXX, Chase reported me as being 30 days late to the credit reporting agencies. From what I can tell, this was due to Chase not processing my automatic payment for some reason or another. Chase never notified me ( call, email, text, mail, etc ) that there was a problem. Had I known this was the case, I certainly wouldve taken care of the matter immediately, which was done upon receiving a notice from XXXX regarding the late. The payment amount was only {$50.00}, which I most certainly had more than enough funds to cover. This late payment has caused my FICO score to drop significantly, since its my only late payment being reported. As a result, my credit limits on other accounts have been cut and interest rates hiked, thus damaging me further. In fact, Chase slashed my limits on multiple accounts with them, plus closed my oldest account. Ive disputed this with the bureaus already and already contacted both customer service and the executive office within Chase, but they refuse to accept any responsibility or have the bureaus remove the 30 day late. At this point, my main option left is mediation with the CFPB or a lawsuit seeking financial damages theyve caused me, which I can certainly provide documentation."

The offer was accepted in XXXX XXXX and was to go to closing in XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, water pipes in the unoccupied house froze and burst with considerable damage. The sale was put on hold. 
The seller filed an insurance claim and was awarded funds for repairs, which were deposited in the Insurance Claims Department of Chase Bank. 
I renewed my offer. About half of the insurance repair work was completed at that point. The reason the work progressed so slowly was that the contractor hired by the seller became difficult to contact and was dismissed after payment for the work completed. The remaining work was for mold remediation, floors and repair to the heating system. A total of {$14000.00} remained in the insurance claims benefit. At this point, my real estate agent informed me that it would be best to accept the remaining money rather than wait for the repairs to be completed because the house might be placed in foreclosure by Chase. With this understanding a new closing was set. 
When we were assured the sale would take place I contacted a new firm to do the work needed for the insurance repairs along with other rehabilitation work on the house. The seller and his agent contacted Chase Bank to add my name to the account for the insurance claims benefits and I was told the bank agreed to this arrangement. On the day of closing the seller and his agent assured me there would be no problems accessing the insurance claims benefits which would be payable to the seller or his assigns. We closed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and our contactor began work on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Shortly after closing I applied to Chase Bank to change the name of the contractor and to begin the process of accessing the funds. I was asked to supply the following ; Declaration of Intent to RepairContractors Lien WaiverInternal Revenue Form XXXXCopy of a certified letter to the original contractor, returned as undeliverableNotarized Hold Harmless Agreement from the SellerCopy of Affidavit of "" Arms Length Transaction '' All of these documents were faxed to XXXX XXXX in the Insurance Claims Department XXXX Chase Bank. From XXXX XXXX until now I have made numerous telephone calls to follow up on this matter. I was told by Chase it would be necessary for "" Corporate '' to approve the change of contractors in order to access the funds. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I made the following series of telephone contacts with these results ; '' XXXX '' in the Insurance Office told me "" Corporate says they will not release any funds until all proper documentation has been submitted. '' I asked to be forwarded to "" Corporate. '' I was told to call XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX at that number said he was in the Checking Department. He told me to call XXXX. Whoever answered that number told me to call XXXX, where, XXXX XXXX told me to call XXXX Customer Service at XXXX. At this number, XXXX XXXX referred me to "" XXXX '' in XXXX XXXX. 
'' XXXX '' informed me that "" A VP wrote a letter saying the insurance money was not included in the short sale so Chase would keep the money. '' She said the letter was sent on XXXX XXXX ( a Sunday ) to an address in Arizona. 
'' XXXX '' then forwarded my call to XXXX XXXX in the Insurance Claims Department who told me she needed documentation that the insurance settlement was to be forwarded to me. 
Realizing that this is where the conversation started. I closed the phone call. 
I have e-mail and fax documentation to all the information above as well as the account number in which the insurance funds were deposited at Chase Bank. 
Based on those conversations, I conclude Chase does not intend to release the funds that are on deposit and instead Chase intends to appropriate the funds to themselves."

So why is chases escalation department refusing to investigate a claim that so why is chases escalation department refusing to investigate a claim that if they called to get a signature or a verbal recording of my authorization Had no verbal recording of my authorization nor had a written confirmation of my authorization so therefore it was an authorized and yet Chase wont investigate or maybe they are investigating but the officer or the representative that I talked to told me specifically that I would have to deal with them by myself because Chase is not going to look into it because I dealt with this company before that company has the right to charge my account whenever they want without my authorization which is not right."

I made 2 authorized telephone transfers, supposedly recorded by Chase, on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX from my bank account to her credit card. In XXXX, XXXX, I discovered that without my consent or approval, {$25000.00} was transferred from my account to her credit card from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately called Chase to report a fraud. Chase determined that these transactions were valid even without my authorization, and without any of my personal information which I never shared with her, because I had made the 2 previous valid transfers to her account. I have asked Chase to provide evidence for the initiation and approval of the unauthorized transfers but they will not provide any such evidence. The problem here is that Chase 's system allows anyone to transfer money from someone else 's account to their own account without any proof that the account they are transferring from belongs to them. I have reported it to the police, the FCC, and XXXX investigates..I first spoke to my private banker on XXXX. She told me I was protected by Chase 's zero liability policy. She filed a fraud claim with Chase which was rejected by mail. I followed up myself with Chase 's fraud department on XX/XX/XXXX but was told there nothing more Chase could do."

We received a case number with that complaint. 

The OCC verbally informed us on today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) that our complaint was referred to CFPB ; however, the representative from CFPB had no records of our complaint ; therefore we are filing our complaint directly with CFPB. 

We are filing a complaint for discrimination based on Race and/or Color. We strongly believe Chase Bank violated our rights to credit, according to the protective - provisions provided in the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibits discrimination in any type of credit transaction, including applying for, or extending credit to small businesses based on race. Furthermore, Chase Bank has not presented us with a letter of declination or any reason for denying us credit. 

Our complaints stem from the lending laws that prohibit discrimination, disparate treatment and disparate impact under Tit

One individual contacted my wife about purchasing a rug. The rug was listed for {$75.00}. The buyer indicated that he would pay {$70.00} to hold the rug. We agreed to sell the rug to the buyer. The buyer sent my wife a check, but the buyer 's husband then called to say that his wife had mistakenly written the check for the {$1000.00} because it included XXXX intended for movers coming to pick up the rug. The buyer asked my wife to remit the {$930.00} to the moving company. 

On XX/XX/2020, my wife called Chase, explained the situation, and asked a Chase representative for confirmation about when it would be safe to proceed to make the payment the buyer was requesting. Chase told my wife that all she needed to do was wait for the amount of the deposited check to post to our checking account. Chase did not mention that the check would still be subject to review for fraud or insufficient funds for several days after the amount had posted as "" cleared. '' Chase also did not instruct my wife to consult any other sources about the timing for checks to "" finally '' clear. 

On XX/XX/2020, my wife did an online deposit of the buyer 's {$1000.00} check. On XX/XX/2020, the funds posted to our checking account as a cleared check. In reliance on Chase 's advice, my wife proceeded to pay the moving company {$930.00} using Chase 's XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX service on XX/XX/2020. The buyer was supposed pick up the rug on XX/XX/2020, when the buyer did not, my wife refunded the buyer on XX/XX/2020 for the {$75.00} portion for the cost of the rug. On XX/XX/2020 -- XXXX days after the {$1000.00} check had posted to our account -- my wife and I were informed that the buyer 's check had been returned as fraudulent. As a result, my wife had been defrauded out of {$1000.00}. 

My wife and I promptly called Chase on the morning of XX/XX/2020 to discuss the situation. We explained that our issue was that Chase had made a representation to my wife about when she could safely proceed to use the funds from the buyer 's check, but had made no reference to the fact that the check was still subject to review after the funds had posted as cleared. After four hours of bouncing around Chase 's various customer service departments, Chase informed us that there was nothing they could do to recover the lost funds and that they would not accept any liability based on the incomplete information from my wife."

This battery cost {$210.00} came with a 30-month warranty which was for a full free exchange of the battery if it was defective. When the battery arrived, it was thrown over the fence and "" may have been '' damaged in delivery but I don't know that for sure. The internal workings of the battery are not visible or accessible. Even if it was damaged in shipping, only "" the shipper '' can file that claim. 
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- It was not installed in my vehicle until after XXXX because I needed help to do that, because the battery weighs more than 50 lbs  and I was not able to lift it up and into my vehicle. There were constant troubles with it losing it's charge, whether the vehicle battery cables were connected or not, and finally in XXXX it discharged while I was shopping, could not be jumped and I had to have my vehicle towed home. The tow service driver did some kind of test on the battery and told me that it appeared to have an internal short. He said there was no way to know whether it was a manufacturing defect or from damage from mishandling in shipping. 
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I first called the manufacturer 's warranty service and they advised me that the seller had to honor the warranty if they were selling the product. So I contacted XXXX via Amazon to request a label and they told me via email that "" they do not ship replacements '', which is to say, they had no intention of honoring the free replacement warranty. 
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- So I contacted Amazon to file an A to Z claim which they did for me and the customer service representative put in the wrong reason for the claim. They submitted that as a "" problem with shipping '' when I had stated the item was defective. So my initial Amazon A to Z claim was denied because the item had been received. I never said it hadn't been. I assert that Amazon Customer Service entered my claim incorrectly so that Amazon wouldn't have to honor it. 
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I put it for reconsideration as DEFECTIVE and Amazon again denied the A to Z claim because I had not used the words "" NOT AS DESCRIBED '', although non-working and defective and incapable of holding a charge would definitely be "" NOT AS DESCRIBED '' for a brand new automotive battery that is reasonably expected to provide years of service. Oh. Amazon also told me that "" the merchant had not refused to exchange the item '', although both Amazon and XXXX BOTH did fail or refuse to send me a return shipping label and XXXX did pretty clearly state in their email that they "" do not ship replacements '', even though "" free replacement '' that is exactly what the warranty states. 
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Somebody asked me why I didn't just return it anyway. Because I inquired XXXX about shipping 50 lbs of hazardous material and it would cost {$180.00}, IF they would even ship it. Amazon routinely hands out return shipping labels. XXXX somehow shipped it for free in the first place. But neither of them would give me a return shipping label. But for me as a private person, the cost is {$180.00}. The defective one already cost me {$210.00} and I still had to buy a working battery. My income is XXXX. I do not have {$600.00} or {$700.00} "" extra '' to play their game. Also the warranty says "" free replacement ''. If I had to pay {$180.00} to return a defective item makes it no longer a free replacement. But the seller already said they "" do not ship replacements '', so why would I? 
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- So after dorking around for several "" business days '' on Amazon 's insistence to wait for communication with the merchant, to wait for consideration of A to Z claims that were not submitted correctly, Amazon told me I would have to dispute the charge with my bank. I did that on XX/XX/XXXX, and Chase Bank issued me a credit, and I went and bought a working battery with that money, which was what I had tried to do in the first place. Or did they think I should sit with a completely disabled vehicle since XXXX while I waited for this? In the meantime, this pandemic happened. 
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Then on Friday XX/XX/XXXX, in the middle of a pandemic and just at the start of the holiday weekend, at approximately XXXX in the afternoon I received a voicemail from Chase Bank that they needed to speak to me "" urgently '' with regard to this claim, and they required additional information from me. The voicemail did not say what additional information was required, which would have been the considerate and expedient thing to do. I called the number instructed to call back "" urgently '' and the hold time was more than 90 minutes to speak to a representative. When the call finally connected, the call was disconnected with no discussion of my claim, whatsoever. My phone battery died when I tried to call again. After I charged the phone and tried to call again, that "" 24/7 '' department was CLOSED. At XXXX XXXX   on the Saturday on a holiday weekend less than 12 hours after receiving the voicemail, I received a letter from my bank that they were reversing the temporary credit because the transaction had been "" authorized ''. I never said the charge was not authorized.

The amount of the price protection refund was to be {$120.00}. 

The initial process of filing the claim through the official site was not smooth. Across multiple computers, and multiple days, I could not get the site to properly function. I eventually had to reach out to Chase to have them email me the form so that I can manually email it back. I believe these defects in the site to be intentional, as a way to frustrate people into not filing claims. 

Several weeks later, I log into the online tracking site ( XXXX ) and see that the claim is pending with a final decision to be made within 5 business days. 

Several more weeks later, on XXXX XXXX, I follow up with the credit card company and I am informed that the complaint should be handled by the end of the week, and I should see a decision on my claim. 

Again, several more weeks pass, and still no movement on the claim being resolved. 

I call Chase again on XXXX XXXX, and they had still not processed the claim, or made any movement whatsoever. The status was still the same as when I had called previously on XXXX XXXX. 

My worry is that per my guide to benefits, the claims must be filed within 21 days of the date of the sale advertisement for the claim to take effect. My claim was filed well within that timeline, but due to the long turnaround time, I worry that if Chase denies the claim due to some sort of a paperwork error, I will not be able to refile the claim as I am outside that window. 

In addition, per the benefits guide, a claim file is only open for 60 days from the date of the claim. Due to the long turn time from Chase, there are only approximately 5 days left before the claim file is closed. 

In addition, as a member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, I am about to conduct a XXXX move to a different duty station within the next 30 days. I am worried that because this process has taken an extended amount of time, any refund check that Chase will send to me will get lost in the mail forwarding due to my change of address."

I would like to dispute the decision for my dispute claim denial. Per my previous complaint, I have also sent my charge dispute directly to XXXX multiple times and also have filed a complaint via XXXX, but XXXX still could not provide me the breakdown of the fees they charged for cancellation of the sale. Per Merchant 's policy ( clearly stated on their website ), it states : "" If you 're unable to deliver tickets on time and as promised, your payment method may be charged an amount generally equal to XXXX % of your ticket cost. "". The ticket price was {$800.00}, so XXXX % should be {$160.00}, instead of the {$480.00} that they charged ( without any explanation or breakdown of the difference )! Please see attached for my initial charge dispute with XXXX. I 've also provided them with proof that the ticket was available, but XXXX refused the ticket. Hence, XXXX forced me to cancel the sale because they did not accept the ticket. Furthermore, XXXX still could not provide me with a specific breakdown of this 'difference ' from {$800.00} to {$480.00}. They agreed to provide courtesy refund, but only {$120.00}, instead of the {$480.00} that they charged directly to my Chase account. So Stub Hub still could not provide the breakdown on how the {$360.00} was determined. 
Additionally, the temporary credit {$480.00} has been removed from my Chase account, so I just need some assistance in fighting this illegal charge with the Merchant. Especially since it was charged by XXXX directly to my Chase checking account. So this dispute should serve as protection as Chase debit/credit customer, and also Chase 's protection to prevent anymore illegal charges from this merchant XXXX. 
Please escalate this matter for further review and more research. Greatly appreciate your assistance and look forward to a better resolution. Thank you."

XX/XX/XXXX I sold the vehicle to a private buyer for the pay off amount of {$10000.00} ( 10 day payoff provided by Chase ). I sent two different checks. One for {$10000.00} and one for {$290.00} ( made the check for a little bit more than payoff ). I sent these checks with tracking to make sure it got there. After a few days it said the check had arrived at Chase 's financing department but they said they never got anything. Chase said they still could not find the checks so they suggested to cancel the checks and get new ones. So thats what I did. They said {$10000.00} was still enough to cover the payoff. I then received a payoff letter that stated the vehicle was paid in full and Delaware title with the lien released signed by Chase by mail that was dated XX/XX/XXXX ( I will attach all of these documents ). When I opened the account I set up automatic payments, once I recieved the title and payoff letter I then canceled the automatic payments because the vehicle was paid in full. XX/XX/XXXX we received a statement from Chase that said {$0.00} was due but the principle balance was {$270.00}. After the second or third time this letter came my dad/step mom called Chase to ask why the letter was still being sent if it was paid in full and about the principle balance. Chase said that if you received a payoff letter/title then the car is paid in full, so after that we didn't think anything of it but we were still receiving these letters and eventually stopped opening them. XX/XX/XXXX my dad gets a call saying you have a past due amount that is due immediately and late fees have been charged since XX/XX/XXXX. Hearing this I immediately thought this was a scam ... how can you tell someone they owe $ 300+ over three years later after Chase told me the car was paid in full and I received title/payoff letter. I called them several times to fix this problem and everyone was extremely rude. I talked to one supervisor and she kept cutting me off saying would you like to pay the amount today because we are adding another late fee and then sending you to collections and then hung up. It took 10 days to receive a call from the head person of Chase finance. I told him my situation and his response was "" you owe the money ... .as soon as our customers say they are paying the vehicle off we automatically start getting titles/payoff letters ready in hopes we have loyal trustworthy customers ''. He then proceeds to tell me the check bounced and was put back in my checking account ... the {$290.00} was a money order, therefore nothing would bounce back into my checking account. His next excuse was well you stopped your automatic payments. Mind you, I stopped them when I received a title/payoff letter. Nothing Chase says adds up and they are making different stories up. I should not have to owe them anything with a payoff letter/title. I then filed a dispute with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XXXX. All three bureaus said it would take 30 days to process and I notified them all that I would be sending documents to support my dispute via mail. By XX/XX/XXXX I received emails that my dispute was completed and updated as accurate information. My credit score then went from XXXX to XXXX and my payment history went from 100 % to 99 %. I then made another dispute for all three bureaus again and contacted them by phone and let them know they didn't give enough time for me to even send over my documents to support my dispute. All three bureaus came back with accurate information and nothing changed. I got nervous because of my credit score dropping so much and I paid Chase {$320.00} ( only help they would give me was one late waive fee charge ). I called Chase and filed a dispute with them last week and asked them to take the late payment off of my credit report. I simply said I shouldn't have had to owe you any money in the first place because your company messed up somewhere but you won and got your money so I would appreciate if you do me the favor and contact the bureaus and taking that off my credit. The customer service representative agreed with me and said I would receive a letter with their decision via mail soon. Yesterday, I received a letter from Chase that said the information was accurate so there is no change necessary. I am getting no where with either Chase or the credit bureaus and this should not have been my fault."

This was news to me, since I had other accounts with chase that were all in great standing and this was the first I was hearing about my missed payment. I called as soon as I learned there was a problem and made two payments in the next few days to square my account. I spoke with a number of representatives some very nice and others not very helpful or understanding. When I asked why they waited over six months to contact me they said they had sent multiple emails and made numerous calls about the issue. I explained I had not received the emails and they insisted I did. I also asked when trying to contact me by phone why there was never a message left? They told me they were not required to leave a message, which makes no sense at all if one is truly trying to resolve a delinquency issue. I finally said, if the other methods all failed, why wait half a year to send me notice by mail. They responded they had sent numerous letters. I never received any emails and I do n't answer numbers I do n't recognize due to the potential of scams. I asked for dates the other letters had been sent to me and they would not provide me with any information. The truth is, I only ever received one written notice and as soon as I did I settled my account. I am not an irresponsible person! I have a few other credit cards with chase one of which I pay for most of my expenses with, and then pay on time every month. I also have a saving and checking as well with Chase and at no time was any serious attempt to contact me sooner through those avenues ever made either.

What business can get a tax deduction for an unpaid debt from years and years ago? If they are not gaining a tax deduction, then why did the submit the 1099-C if it is not an attempt to leverage the IRS against me or as retaliation for debts on their financial ledger they can not collect on because they are legally time barred? Since XXXX or XXXX the IRS changed their rule requiring creditors notify debtors of the forgiven debt within 36 months, now that that IRS rule has been eliminated it appears that the lender is taking liberty to go back years and years on time barred from legal action debts and taking a legal action anyway by filing a fraudulent 1099-C. I don't think the 1099-C can possibly be valid on such an old debt. This is consumer financial abuse for debts that are already time barred. The private student loans total {$19000.00} which is a great deal of tax I am being required to pay now. How can this be legal? Is it simply because a lender sends in a 1099-C?"

We have run several XXXX dollars through our accounts over the years. Prior to the current issues on my Chase credit card, I have never had a negative mark on my credit reports and my scores were well over 800. 

My wife and I are wanting to refinance our home in both of our names, however, when we had our lender pull credit, we were shocked to see a huge decrease in my scores due to recent 30 - 60 day late marks reporting from Chase. This account was to be closed and paid off at the same time the branch closed my business deposit accounts. 

After months of going back and forth it seems the branch closed by deposit accounts correctly and they even closed by credit card, but they failed to transfer the money to pay off the card balance during the transactions as authorized in person by me during the closure process. Since I lost my online banking access with the closure of my accounts, I wasnt made aware of the balance not being paid off and that bank fees were added to my account, in error. Eventually the bank removed the fees and I paid the account off but that was after I was already reported past due to the credit bureaus thus dropping my credit scores 60XXXX points."

She looked it up and said that that resulted from unpaid credit card fees, late payments fees, and interest. This is very concerning considering we have canceled the card at the beginning of the year after paying it off in one payment. XXXX said she was going to print out some statements for me to pick up at the bank branch later, and I have those statements now. 

An additional issue has begun today. I have started receiving phone calls from XXXX in XXXX Florida. There have been several calls to my phone from this number just this morning, and not one single voice message. I had my friend Who is well-versed in computer technology do a search on this number. According to XXXX, this number belongs to Chase Bank collections department. According to XXXX notes, people report receiving dozens of calls from this number a day, some have noted that it is an automated message from Chase bank. Personally I do not respond to an identified collars, or computers that call me, when there is no voice message left as an explanation. 

According to the statements, the only thing Chase Bank did after my request to cancel the Amazon Prime credit card, is open up a new one with a new account number without my knowledge or consent."

Furthermore, Chase in doing so is also not honoring disputed transactions and in doing so is violating terms of service. 
I am demanding a refund on a disputed transaction, and there is no one available to service the dispute which has been reported on line and no temporary credit as stated is taking place."

This company filed a small claims judgment in the amount of {$2600.00} XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXXthey began more legal action to get the judgment amount. The wage garnishment started XX/XX/XXXX and has every year until now. They have thus far collected {$2300.00} since XXXX yet the amount owed on the judgment keeps going up ( its up to {$6200.00} ) currently  because this company is still adding interest on a account that has been closed before XXXX and charged off. I do not feel responsible for these so called finance charges and take responsibility for the original judgment of {$2600.00} which is almost paid up. I think this company is taking advantage and unfairly charging me these outrageous amounts for a credit card I have not had in almost 10years. These  garnishments really put financial hardships on single parents like me who are trying to make ends meet and trying to pay off debt.

They have refused to provide this original consumer contract for MONTHS and the bureaus have been complicit.

Further, never is a company to just STATE that an account is "" verified '', "" accurate '', and "" valid '' without actually proving these to be so. I am outraged that in 7 months, I have not received what I requested. It is extremely important to my person and identity as a consumer to make sure that what is reporting in my credit files has been TRULY, PROPERLY verified & validated. I DEMAND that JPM Chase provide an original consumer contract / original instrument of indebtedness in its original form ; if they do not, then I demand that this account be IMMEDIATELY DELETED from my credit reports. The law states under FCRA Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) that original consumer documentation is required to consumers, particularly upon their request. Furthermore, you have also failed to provide the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. It is a crying shame that it takes upwards of 7 months of pleading to get what you're owed as a consumer.

I am reaching out to you today b/c for the 3rd time this year-I have had my card compromised. I went to activate my replacement card yesterday but the bank lady said it was already active and there were already charges using the new card. I had just taken it out of the sealed envelope. I believe that the fraud is coming from within the Chase organization and is much larger of an issue than what Chase is reporting ( if they are even reporting this fraud-I cant be the only one dealing with this ongoing headache and fraud ) I am paid one time a month and I believe that this is known by whoever is frauding my account. The fact that I had charges and an activated card before I even opened the envelope should tell Chase representatives that there is a large issue. I have to keep changing all of my autopayments.

XXXX XXXX presented a Chase Bank employee with a letter and documents "" showing '' that he was a majority owner in the company XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX, an Illinois limited liability company ( "" XXXX '' ). The document that Mr. XXXX presented was on XXXX letterhead, created by Mr. XXXX himself. The Chase Bank employee looked up XXXX on the Illinois Secretary of State website and noted to Mr. XXXX that he was NOT ( 1 ) a Manager listed on the state 's website, nor ( 2 ) a signatory on the account. Mr. XXXX persuaded the Chase Bank employee that the Illinois Secretary of State website was incorrect and that the documents that Mr. XXXX had provided should show that he should be added as a signatory. 

Two days later, on XX/XX/2019, the XXXX XXXX Chase Bank added Mr. XXXX as a signatory. In those two days, Chase Bank never contacted the sole signatory on the account to verify whether Mr. XXXX should be added as a signatory. In those two days, Chase Bank never contacted the Manager listed on the Illinois Secretary of State website to verify if Mr. XXXX should be added as a signatory. In those two days, Chase Bank never contacted the Chase Bank branch office where the business account was opened and maintained to verify whether Mr. XXXX should be added as a signatory. Instead, Chase Bank added Mr. XXXX as a signatory, and then proceeded to request {$10000.00} in cash and the remaining funds in the account ( approximately {$22000.00} ) to be provided to him in a cashiers check. Chase Bank complied, and provided {$10000.00} cash to Mr. XXXX and provided the remaining amount in a cashier 's check. 

XXXX learned of the fraud on Thursday, XX/XX/2019 and immediately contacted Chase Bank to report it. Chase Bank stated that someone would be in touch, providing the name "" XXXX '', but that as an initial matter "" Mr. XXXX provided Chase Bank with all the necessary documentation to become a signatory on the account. '' No one at Chase Bank responded all day on Friday. At COB Friday, XXXX contacted Chase Bank and spoke with "" XXXX '' who said that the matter was escalated to XXXX, and he would likely call on Monday. 

When XXXX did not call the morning of XX/XX/2019, XXXX called him directly and left several messages. When XXXX finally connected with XXXX later that afternoon, XXXX informed XXXX that it had not performed any investigation, but would be in touch. 

On XX/XX/2019, XXXX called XXXX to state that the investigation was still ongoing, but that XXXX 's accounts were now frozen. XXXX reminded Chase Bank that XXXX was the victim as BUT FOR the Chase Bank employee 's failure to abide by internal banking policies and procedures, XXXX would still have its business funds and would not be impeded from performing its business. Although Mr. XXXX MAY HAVE provided necessary documentation, NONE of Mr. XXXX 's documentation or stories were verified by anyone at XXXX or a signatory on the account. 

On XX/XX/2019, Chase Bank responded to XXXX that "" Mr. XXXX provided all the necessary documentation to become a signatory on the account '' even though he was never a signatory on the account and never a manager or controller of the company at any time. XXXX XXXX was a stranger to the XXXX business account, yet Chase Bank added him as a signatory and assisted him with fraudulently withdrawing all {$32000.00} in its business account. 

XXXX is stunned that Chase Bank would take this position when it is absolutely implicated in this fraud, has insurance to cover it's role in perpetrating this fraud, denies any liability in the act, and has significantly impeded XXXX 's ability to do business by not reinstating those funds. 

Today, XXXX filed a complaint with the local law enforcement and the FBI. XXXX maintains Chase 's failure to adhere to its internal banking policies and procedures to prevent this fraud."

On XX/XX/XXXX I was the victim of identity and fraud. The thieves filed a claim with my bank, Chase, for the last three months of car payments that I had made, I have documentation, and the bank placed a credit for the amount of {$1100.00}, while it was happening I was made aware that fraud was happening to my account, I called Chase and alerted they're security department of what was / had happened. They tried to stop it but the crooks had already taken the money. Which caused an over draft for the money. I received a letter from Chase stating that they had finished their investigation and had removed the credit, as they should have. And on the date stated in the letter, the XX/XX/XXXX, I thought that they would have credited back to my car loan company the money. They had not released the money. I started getting phone calls from the finance company, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX telling me that I was three months behind on my payments. I explained that I was the one who informed them that they and I were the victims of fraud and that I had filled reports with both the FBI and XXXX  Police department for the incident and that Chase was supposed to release the money around the 19 th. They didn't release the money. I started getting phone calls from the finance company, each one meaner then the prior call. I kept explaining, and I got no where. Chase didn't give me a reason why the money wasn't released. I have been in communication with the finance company the whole time this is happening. If I had missed a call from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I always called back. On Monday I had two missed calls, one was unknown number and one was anonymous.

I asked why wasn't I contacted and was told that I ignored their phone calls. That's when I remembered the calls mentioned above. I replayed the voicemail, I listened to it six different times before I could figure out who and what they said, very low and fast, "" XXXX XXXX XXXX. '' That was all. I saved it. I spent the next several hours on the phone with Chase and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and that is when I finally found someone with Chase to tell me that they didn't intend to release the money until the XX/XX/XXXX When I asked why it was because they could, they said that the law gave them 45 days before they had to release the funds. When I told them that they had repossessed my car the only thing that they said was sorry. Meanwhile XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is reporting that they repossessed my car with the credit bureaus for late payments"

I do this electronically. I was under the impression that this was the correct thing to do, and in 2015 I have consistent records showing a payment to my credit card every month. In some months, I even paid down the cards twice. 

Chase, however, had my due-date set for the end of the month and so paying at the beginning of the month resulted in XXXX late fees. I believe that Chase sets end of month due-dates in order to confuse customers like myself, and this is an abuse of their power over their customers. 

Because I did not notice these late fees until now when I am preparing my taxes, Chase is refusing to refund me the money even though they agree that indeed, I did pay my credit card every month -- sometimes even twice in a month. 

I would like Chase to refund me these XXXX fees from XXXX and XXXX of last year - totally {$80.00}. In addition to my checking account, I have a mortgage currently being held by chase. They need to refund this money in order to keep me as a customer - I will absolutely transfer my accounts elsewhere."

Last year a woman fabricated XXXX charges against me when I discovered she was a con woman. It is not a crime to lie to any one -- unless you are under oath. Therefore, absolutely illegal and morally reprehensible from someone, who is the transgressor, witth more XXXX criminal charges in XXXX states to say such a thing. Why? because the justice system was XXXX for personal gain at the expense of an unknown, innocent individual who was deftly put into a 6 month statute of limitations, never mind you, i 'm gon na get hauled down to lockup on a thursday with a judge who has a full docket. 

The check in question needs to be reversed or I am going to the people with this, and that does end well for you guys. A bulge brakcet bank, honoring a cimrinal over a faithfully loyal customer? 

If I remain idle -- am I doing the correct thing? Or is it enough to just accept that bad things happen to good people and that 's okay? Please I would love to know the offi8cal moral stance taken by the firm 's PR agency of Choice. 

I am being told by chase that deadlines are deadlines -- tough XXXX. 

I '' m telling you that extenuating circumstances, will be the bane of Chase Bank 's existence going forward. If I am your customer and someonee steald my check and writes my signature and the handwriting analysis is incontrovertible -- what more do you want? 
Oh I have to know when my XXXX is styolen? 


NO. 

NO. 

NO. 

Chase has failed me as a customer on a level that I can not tolerate as man who is doing all that he can to restore his belief in the the american justice system. 

The idea that this is my fault is tragic. 

Additionally, the check in questoin was submitted initially and returned. I was never made aware of any of this and chase will not acknowledge this. That 's great -- because it 's a legal obligation on their behalf. I never got anything about a bounced check, and a check that was not sufficietly funded goes without notification to the account owner and apparently run again and I guess I had the dough at that point. No clue what was happening. 

Please, show me how your isistence and outright coercive attempts to get me to admit on a recorded line things I have absolutely certainty over. Now that is terrifying -- terrifying. Because what we have here, is the brick and morter teller becoming emotionally attached to my cauase and the next thing I know she is having heated words with a colleague who had no problem trying to dupe me -- yeah I 'm XXXX -- but i had another chase person advocating for me. 

How on earth is this a sitatuuoin that chase XXXX bank can allow to happen? 

Patheric. utterly pathetic. I will move on next to the XXXX if they have one at Chase. nothing about being caught ibetween to co-workers is professionaly acceptable. 

I look fortward to a civil suit. It 's on."
