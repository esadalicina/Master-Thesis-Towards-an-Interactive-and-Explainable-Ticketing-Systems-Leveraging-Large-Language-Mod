I understand your frustration with Chase Bank's cardmember services. When disputing a debt, it's your right as a consumer to request validation of that debt, and receiving a mere statement doesn't suffice.To address this issue, I recommend taking the following steps: Send a Certified Letter: Draft a certified letter to Chase Bank reiterating your request for debt validation. Clearly state that you require proper validation according to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). Document Everything: Keep records of all communications with Chase, including copies of letters sent, certified mail receipts, and any responses received.Seek Legal Assistance: If Chase continues to harass you for payment without providing proper validation, consider seeking legal assistance. There are consumer protection laws in place to safeguard your rights in these situations.File a Complaint: If necessary, file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) or your state's attorney general's office. They can investigate the matter and take appropriate action if Chase is found to be in violation of debt collection laws.Remember, you have rights as a consumer, and Chase Bank must adhere to the law when attempting to collect a debt. Don't hesitate to assert those rights and seek resolution to this matter."
